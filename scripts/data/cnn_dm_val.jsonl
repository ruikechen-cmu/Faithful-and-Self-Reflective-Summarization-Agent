A father-of-two has built a career that children around the world can only dream of - making spectacular works of art out of Lego.

Now a professional, he is the only person in Britain to be officially recognised by the famous Danish toy company. Duncan Titmarsh gave up his stable job as a kitchen fitter five years ago to pursue his unique career as Britain's only professional Lego builder . Mr Titmarsh, 42, from Farnham, Surrey, has loved Lego since he first played with it as a child. In a huge warehouse in Bordon, Hampshire, he has a staggering six million pieces of Lego that he uses to carry out his day-to-day work. He set up and works for Bright Bricks, the UK’s only Lego-certified building company. He is currently building a Lego engine for a Rolls Royce and recreating the East Village from the London 2012 Olympics. The most prestigious project he has worked on was the huge 14ft, 400,000-piece Lego Christmas Tree in St Pancras station in 2011. He also creates large mosaics of pictures and has recreated famous work by artist, Banksy. Mr Titmarsh says that his friends and family thought he was mad when he decided to become a professional Lego builder but that he loves his job . In a huge warehouse in Hampshire, Mr Titmarsh has six million pieces of Lego with which he builds his models. As an official Lego builder, he gets the bricks at a discounted price . It takes Mr Titmarsh anything from two days to two weeks to complete his work. Since becoming a professional Lego maker in 2008 he has made more than 400 bespoke pieces of art using the blocks. He said: ‘Like most children I loved playing with Lego when I was younger, but I never thought it would be my job later in life. ‘Everyone loves Lego and I picked up my first set in Woolworths when I was just a little boy. He is currently building a Lego engine for a Rolls Royce (pictured) and recreating the East Village from the London 2012 Olympics . It takes Mr Titmarsh anything from two days to two weeks to complete a piece and he has so far built more than 400 . ‘I enjoyed making Technic Lego sets and Lego Space when it first came out.’ After working for five years as a kitchen fitter in Farnham, the father-of-two made the brave decision to give that up to pursue his dream. He said: ‘It was hard at first to make the change, and my family and close friends thought I was mad. ‘But I’m thrilled that I made the change when I did as it’s something that I enjoy doing every day.’ There are estimated to be just three or four people in the world who make a full-time living from building structures of the plastic bricks. He says that he loves the variety in his work and the fantastic reactions he gets from people when they see his creations . To mark 150 years of London Underground Mr Titmarsh has created a series of Lego London Underground maps showing how the Tube network has evolved over time. The image shows how the map will look in 2020 . Being a certified Lego builder allows Mr Titmarsh to buy bricks directly from the Danish company at a discount. He spends up to eight hours a day in the warehouse building a variety of designs. He said: ‘I love the variety in my work; you just don’t know what you’re going to be doing each day. ‘Each day is different and until people send in their photographs and designs - I don’t know what I’ll be working on. ‘I love to see the work when it’s finished and the recognition and response I receive from people is fantastic. ‘You could say that it’s every boy’s dream to play and work with Lego for the rest of their life - I love it.’", "reference": "Duncan Titmarsh gave up his job as a kitchen fitter to work with Lego .\nThe 42-year-old is Britain's only official professional Lego builder .\nHe has six million pieces of Lego in a huge warehouse in Hampshire .\nIs currently building a Lego engine for Rolls Royce and recreating the East Village from the London 2012 Olympics ."}

A Texas actress who sent ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and then-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and tried to blame the crime on her soon-to-be ex-husband was today sentenced to 18 years in prison. A federal judge gave Shannon Guess Richardson, 36, the maximum sentence under her plea deal on a federal charge of possessing and producing a biological toxin. Richardson was also ordered to pay restitution. She had pleaded guilty to the charge in December. 'I never intended for anybody to be hurt,' she told the court, adding later, 'I'm not a bad person; I don't have it in me to hurt anyone.' Sentencing: Wearing restraints, Shannon Guess Richardson is escorted out of the federal courthouse in Texarkana, Texas on Wednesday, July 16, 2014 after she was sentenced to 18 years prison . Richardson, who had minor acting roles in film and television, said she thought security measures would prevent anyone from opening the letters addressed to Obama and the now-former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Prosecutors say Richardson mailed three letters from New Boston, outside Texarkana, then went to police and claimed that her estranged husband had done it. She was arrested last June after authorities said she tried to implicate her husband, who had filed for divorce. Prosecutors say investigators noted inconsistencies in Richardson's statements and later learned that she had purchased materials online to produce ricin, a toxin that can cause respiratory failure if inhaled. Poses: Her husband said Shannon, who had had minor roles in TV shows, had always wanted to be famous . Blamed: After sending the ricin letters to Obama and Bloomberg, she allegedly called the FBI and said that she had found notes written by her husband Nathaniel (right) to the president . She acknowledged in a signed plea agreement that she ordered castor beans online and learned how to process them into a substance used to make ricin. She obtained an email address, a PayPal shopping account and a post office box in her husband's name without his knowledge, according to the document. On the morning of May 20, 2013, she said she waited for her husband Nathan Richardson to go to work. 'After he left the house, I printed the mailing labels for President Barack Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Mark Glaze with The Raben Group,' she said in the document. At the time, Glaze was director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Bloomberg's group advocating for tougher gun control. Probe: Investigators can be seen outside the couple's home in New Boston, Texas in June . Locked up: Richardson's lawyer said the plea deal is expected to cap her sentence at 18 years . The letter to Obama read, 'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what ive got in store for you mr president,' according to the document. 'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns. Anyone wants to come to my house will get shot in the face.' After mailing the letters, she admitted to trying to blame her husband and lying to authorities. Richardson performed minor roles in the television series 'The Walking Dead' and the movie 'The Blind Side.' She also is the mother of six children - including one born prematurely while she was in custody.", "reference": "A federal judge gave Shannon Guess Richardson, 36, the maximum sentence under her plea deal on a federal charge of possessing and producing a biological toxin .\nRichardson was also ordered to pay restitution .\nShe had pleaded guilty to the charge in December .\nThe small time actress also sent ricin-laced letters to then-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and tried to blame the crime on her husband ."}
{"id": 15004, "article": "Egypt's military-backed government resigned Monday, adding new uncertainty to the nation's three years of upheaval. The government headed by Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi turned in its resignation to President Adly Mansour, state-run Nile TV reported. Mansour accepted the resignations and thanked the prime minister and his Cabinet for their service. \"The presidency greatly values the tireless efforts of Dr. Beblawi and members of the government at a pivotal moment in the nation's history,\" Mansour said in a statement. State media reported that Mansour is expected to appoint a transitional prime minister in the coming days who will be tasked with putting together a new Cabinet to manage state affairs until presidential elections in April. The resignations come as disorganized strikes ripple through the work force.  In recent weeks, doctors, low-ranking police officers, postal workers, transport workers and textile workers have all gone on strike for short periods of time. Analysts expect army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who served as defense minister, to run for president.  The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has said it would support an El-Sisi candidacy. If he does run, El-Sisi would need to give up his post. But with no clear contender, his chances of winning the presidency are high. If elected, he will become the sixth military leader to rule Egypt since its independence. Egypt's government has been unsettled since a popular revolt toppled the 29-year rule of former strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Mohamed Morsy, the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, was elected president in 2012. Shortly after he winning, he resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party in an effort to show that he would represent all Egyptians. But he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts, including organizing attacks on Egyptian troops in the Sinai Peninsula and fueling \"sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in Egypt.\" Supporters say the military-backed government that replaced Morsy has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak.", "reference": "Egypt's government has been in turmoil since 2011 .\nA string of disorganized strikes has rippled through the economy .\nAnalysts expect army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi to run for president .\nHe would have to resign his military post to do so ."}

Police say Barry C. Jernigan, a 35-year-old electrician, called his employer and made disturbing and suicidal comments before the shooting Sunday night. The employer called officers, who arrived at the home in Chesterfield, Virginia, outside Richmond, in time to heard gunfire inside, but too late to save the family.

Barry Jernigan and Alexis were found inside the small, white, ranch-style home with a plastic play set on the front porch and trampoline in the backyard. They and the mother died at the scene. A police spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon told MailOnline Barry Jernigan legally owned the gun he used used in the shootings. Police had never been called to the house for domestic violence reports. However, court records show Jernigan was found guilty in 1999 of reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter. The details of that case were not immediately clear. On Monday morning, neighbors tried to cope with the tragedy while standing near the house with two cars in the driveway that was surrounded by yellow police tape. 'It saddens me to think, Father's Day, of all days.You go home and shoot your kids, really?' said next-door neighbor Cindy Nguyen, 29, whose husband tried to save Renotta and little Seth. Mrs Nguyen said Renotta had stumbled out of the front door Sunday before collapsing on the lawn. Nguyen said that she didn't know the family too well but that the father worked nights, 'seemed fine,' and typically made small talk with neighbors since the Jernigans moved into the home about two years ago.

He said his son wished him a happy Father's Day and told him he planned to hang around the house until he left for work that evening. While he had helped the family financially, Mr Jernigan said his son didn't talk to him much about family business, adding that he had been in and out of jobs since graduating from Dinwiddie High School in 1997.

Jernigan said he couldn't understand what would've led his son to kill his family and then himself, saying he sounded normal when they last spoke. 'I don't know why he took that little baby, that little baby was the world to me,' he said. 'Seems like something you'd seen on TV, you'd never think it would happen personally.'

{"id": 15007, "article": "Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- The general and his soldiers have spent more than a decade at war in Iraq and Afghanistan but this could be one of their toughest battles yet. Their enemy this time is not soldiers or militants. It is Ebola -- invisible and killing thousands in Liberia. Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army Africa who is leading the advance team into Liberia, says the mandate here -- straight from President Barack Obama -- is different from other missions. \"We were brought in to provide our unique capabilities and fill the gaps,\" the two-star general says. In other words, Williams and his troops are here in a supporting role and not a leading one. Fight ready . But Williams --who still remembers his college game when he tackled American Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino -- also looks and sounds like he's ready for this fight. As two Osprey military aircraft appear on the horizon, signalling the opening of an air bridge from Senegal that will put more U.S. troops on the ground in Liberia, Williams can't contain his excitement. \"You want to know where the U.S. military is? It's right here,\" the general says, pointing skyward. But tackling Ebola is a tough task and six months after the start of the unprecedented outbreak, critics say the international response continues to be woefully slow. At Liberian government-run Ebola care units, overcrowding has forced patients to sleep on the floors and many healthcare workers who say they've gone weeks since their last pay checks are now threatening to strike. \"There is no question in my mind that we are making an impact,\" the U.S. unit's chief medical officer, Colonel Jim Czarnik says. \"It is about doing it quickly but you don't want to sprint to failure. \" Game changer . Czarnik points to four recently opened Ebola testing labs, run by military personnel that are already making a difference. Thanks to one lab in Bong County, patients now wait hours, not days to get test results. This means patients who test negative spend less time in isolation with those that test positive. \"It's a game changer,\" says Sean Casey, project manager at a care center run by the International Medical Corps charity that sits just minutes down the road from the U.S. Naval laboratory. \"Patients were afraid at one point of coming to an Ebola treatment unit because they were afraid of becoming infected. Now that we have the lab, patients can get the results back within hours.\" But there are just four labs in a country where nearly 1,000 cases of Ebola have been confirmed. As Williams inspected the construction of the Monrovia Medical Unit, a facility specifically for infected health workers to be run by U.S. government health teams, a crowd of local residents monitors progress from just across the road. \"While we'll do a lot of tangible things -- we'll build this hospital, we'll build the Ebola treatment units, provide these labs -- there's a lot of intangible nature to this fight,\" he said. You want to give people the resilience, the hope that they can fight this thing and see this through.\" His U.S. Army Africa advance team is tiny compared to the 101st Airborne that will be replacing them in the coming weeks. President Obama has authorized up to 4,000 troops to West Africa and since mid-September the few hundred soldiers, sailors and airmen and women in Liberia have been laying the groundwork to make sure that larger force has the housing, medical and logistics in place when they begin to arrive. \"Soldiers are used to moving toward the sounds of the guns. These are the loudest guns that the world has heard in a long time. \"There is no better fight worth fighting then the one in Liberia right now,\" says Czarnik.

Pointon, chairman of the Kent Police Federation, which represents . rank-and-file officers, told BBC Radio Kent: 'I think it was probably a . disaster from start to finish, in fairness. 'It . was an ill-advised concept and from within Kent Police I know that Mrs . Barnes was advised not to do it. It was never going to end well. 'I . think, sadly, it has turned Kent Police by association into something . of a laughing stock. Social media was alight with comments.' Viewers took to Twitter during and after the hour-long programme to say ex-teacher Mrs Barnes was an 'embarrassment' to Kent Police. Viewers attacked Mrs Barnes on Twitter, comparing her to comedy characters David Brent and Alan Partridge . Website . users compared her to Ricky Gervais' character from The Office, David Brent, with one commenting that the show was 'depressingly hilarious, hilariously depressing'. One viewer . tweeted: 'What an embarrassment Ann Barnes, PCC for Kent Police, is. Anybody watching this car crash TV? I'm not sure if this is a joke or . not.' Another said: 'Ann Barnes was like Kent's very own David Brent. A total embarrassment and waste of taxpayers' money.' The show was seen as a damning indictment of the elected roles, with 88 per cent of the more than 1,000 people who voted in a poll on local news website KentOnline saying they didn't think the Commissioner did a good job. This afternoon, a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign' was flown over Maidstone, Kent where Mrs Barnes works. A plane towing the banner, whose pilot refused to say to paid for the sign, circled Kent Police HQ for around a quarter of an hour shortly after midday today. Mrs Barnes was branded a 'laughing stock' by a police officers, who said the programme was a 'disaster' After she was attacked by police officers and the public over the show, Mrs Barnes attempted to deflect criticism this morning, claiming that the programme put 'too much emphasis on me as an individual' Mrs Barnes tried to play down public anger at the show this morning, publishing a defence of her decision to appear on TV on her website. On what her 'Crime Onion' means: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.' On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' She wrote: 'Many people have given their views on the programme and have speculated about my motivation for doing it. 'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people to better understand the job of a police and crime commissioner. 'The decision to let a film crew examine the work of the office for four months was not one I took lightly. 'I hoped it would give an insight into what is being done to help achieve the best possible police service for Kent. 'The film does go some way to addressing the complexities of the job and illustrates some of the challenges involved. 'But I am disappointed that there is too much emphasis on me as an individual and not enough on the work of the office. 'I know . that much of what the office has achieved was filmed and I am frustrated . that these scenes did not make it through to the final version.' Mrs Barnes . was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite . previously branding the Government's plan to increase police . accountability a 'wilful waste of money'. Ann Barnes stands next to Paris Brown, Britain's first youth crime commissioner who quit when it was revealed she had posted a series of highly offensive comments online . She . became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago . when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris . Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online. Miss . Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was . given the role of helping the force ‘stay in touch with young people’. She . called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers . ‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent . reference to a teacher at her former school. Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit. Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money . Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’. They were brought in across England and Wales in November 2012 by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account. But lack of enthusiasm for the reform meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out. They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable. The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire chief constables but this rarely happened. But one of the elected crime tsars branded them £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with senior officers. The Labour PCC for the West Midlands Bob Jones confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners did not make them run better nor made the public safer. PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including: . Cumbria’s Tory PCC Richard Rhodes took two chauffeur-driven trips to meetings, costing taxpayers £700, and when the news was leaked to a local paper, the whistleblower was arrested. PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job. A dozen or so PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them. At least four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct. Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses, including Norfolk’s Stephen Bett who declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He agreed to repay £3,000.", "reference": "Police and Crime Commissioner mauled over 'car crash' Channel 4 show .\nShe was shown struggling to explain her job and using management speak .\nPublic have attacked her £85,000-a-year role on Twitter after documentary .\nShe is compared to David Brent and Alan Partridge by viewers on Twitter .\nPolice officers are also angry, branding show 'a disaster from start to finish'\nShe goes online to defend herself, attacking the programme's editors .\nCritics fly banner over city where she works urging her to resign ."}

Kevin Evanto said authorities got a 911 call shortly after 9:30 a.m. reporting the blast at the United States Steel Corporation's Clairton Plant, which the company says is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the United States. \"It appears one of the coke ovens at the plant exploded,\" Evanto said. Most of the injuries are burn-related, he said, although one person was taken to the hospital with chest pains. Victims are being treated at various hospitals in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area, Evanto added, with one person being transported by helicopter. \"At this point, we believe everybody is accounted for,\" the spokesman said. The United States Steel Corporation told CNN in an e-mail Wednesday it is investigating the incident. \"U. S. Steel's Security & Fire Protection Services personnel are working with local emergency responders,\" wrote company spokeswoman Erin DiPietro. \"We will assess the extent of repairs and impact on operations at a later time.\" The plant has 12 coke oven batteries that produce approximately 4.7 million tons of coke annually, according to the United States Steel Corporation website. The ovens heat coal at extremely high temperatures to carbonize it so it becomes coke -- a fuel used for producing steel. Fire crews were still on the scene at midday, extinguishing remaining flames, Evanto said. Video from CNN affiliate WPXI showed ambulances and emergency crews in front of the coke plant. It also showed a side of the facility that was missing an entire wall, with cinder blocks strewn across a wide area. The plant is located about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh.

Michael Lawton, 54, went on the rampage after he was plagued by local youths who pulled pranks on him that pushed him over the edge, making him attempt to explode a local Morrisons petrol station . A homeowner has been jailed for trying to blow up his street by setting fire to a petrol station with a candle after 'flipping' over years of abuse from his neighbours. Michael Lawton, 54, took the drastic action after he was plagued by local yobs who made his life 'a misery'. A court heard he flipped after having his windows smashed, his car tyres let down and eggs thrown at his house in Milehouse, Staffordshire. In a bid to deal with the nuisance neighbours 'once and for all' Lawton planned to destroy the entire street by blowing up a local petrol station in a drastic act of revenge. On July 9 last year he went to a nearby Morrisons supermarket armed with just a candle and a bucket where he cut five different hoses in an attempt to set a monster blaze. But because it was 1.45am the petrol pumps had been shut down and he only succeeded in lighting a small fire at the base of one pump. After returning back to his home following his botched attempt Lawton decided to hand himself into police four days later. He told police he had taken matters into his own hands because they had done nothing to help him since neighbours started picking on him two years ago. At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Wednesday Lawton pleaded guilty to attempted arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Lawton tried to blow up this Morrisons petrol station in Milehouse, Staffordshire, in a bid to kill himself and destroy the road where those making his life a misery by constantly pulling pranks on him lived, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard . He was jailed for two-and-a-half years by Judge Paul Glenn who told him the consequences of his actions could have been 'catastrophic'. He added: 'Your actions were highly dangerous. It is a matter of pure good fortune that you did not cause a significant fire. 'You do not suffer from a mental disorder. 'The problems that you detail... do not begin to justify what you did. 'Your actions could have been catastrophic.' Lawton called police on July 12 to admit to his crime - adding that he had intended to blow himself up and take the drive where he lived 'with him.' Prosecutor David Bennett told the court that staff returned to the station the next morning to find £1,250 worth of damage to the forecourt. Mr Bennett said that CCTV footage later revealed Lawton 'messing around' by the pumps in the early hours and using a bucket as a wind breaker as he attempted to set the fire. Stuart Clarks, defending, said that if his client had not called police he would never have been caught. The 54-year-old, was fed-up with yobs on his drive smashing his windows, letting his car tyres down and throwing eggs at his house on Wilmot Drive (shown here) in Milehouse, Staffordshire . He said: 'He was the victim of a number of crimes. 'His car tyres were targeted on a number of occasions, his windows had been smashed in the house and eggs had been thrown at the house. 'His face did not fit. 'He contacted the police and local authority about the problem with youths in the area and nothing happened.' One resident on the street said he felt sorry for his neighbour who had become the target of local youths. The father-of-three, who did not wish be named, said: 'They’ve been picking on him for a couple of years and I know he had complained about them.

{"id": 15016, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon has taken the first steps toward repealing the military's controversial \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding gay and lesbian service members, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday. Laying the groundwork for a repeal of the policy will take more than a year, Gates said. In the interim, however, the Defense Department will start enforcing the policy \"in a fairer manner,\" he told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. President Obama called for a repeal of the policy during last week's State of the Union address. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen also endorsed a repeal Tuesday, telling the committee it is his \"personal belief\" that \"allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly [in the military] would be the right thing to do.\" \"For me, personally, it comes down to integrity,\" he said. \"The question before us is not whether the military prepares to make this change, but how we best prepare for it,\" Gates told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"We have received our orders from the commander in chief and we are moving out accordingly.\" But the ultimate decision on whether to repeal the policy, he acknowledged, rests with Congress. The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, enacted under President Clinton in 1993, bars openly gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving in the U.S. military, but prevents the military from asking a service member's sexual orientation. It has been a political lightning rod since its implementation. \"I am mindful ... that attitudes towards homosexuality may have changed considerably -- both in society generally and in the military\" since 1993, Gates said. To prepare the military for what has been a long-anticipated change, Gates said he has already appointed a \"high-level\" working group to \"immediately begin a review of the issues associated with properly implementing a repeal.\" \"The mandate of this working group is to thoroughly, objectively and methodically examine all aspects of this question and produce its finding and recommendations in the form of an implementation plan by the end of this calendar year,\" Gates told the committee members. \"A guiding principle of our efforts will be to minimize disruption and polarization within the ranks, with special attention paid to those serving on the front lines.\" The working group will be led by Department of Defense General Counsel Jeh Johnson and Gen. Carter Ham, commander of U.S. Army Europe, Gates said. The group will \"reach out to the [military] ... to authoritatively understand their views and attitudes about the impacts of repeal,\" he added. \"I expect that the same sharp divisions that characterize the debate over these issues outside of the military will quickly seek to find their way into this process.\" Gates noted that the Pentagon will ask the RAND Corporation to update a study it conducted in 1993 on the impact of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. He also said he has directed the Defense Department to \"quickly review the regulations used to implement\" the law and, within 45 days, present possible changes that will allow for more humane enforcement. The secretary acknowledged the impatience many political observers and activists may have with the timetable for a repeal. \"I expect that our approach may cause some to wonder why it will take the better part of the year to accomplish this task,\" he said. \"We looked at a variety of options, but when you take into account the overriding imperative -- to get this right and minimize disruption to a force that is actively fighting two wars and working through the stress of almost a decade of combat -- then it is clear to us that we must proceed in a manner that allows for the thorough examination of all issues.\" In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll in April 2009, 48 percent of Americans favored maintaining the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Thirty-seven percent opposed the policy because they believed it treated homosexuals too harshly, while another 8 percent opposed it because they believed it treated homosexuals too leniently. \"'Don't ask, don't tell' to many people, including myself, seemed so reasonable,\" Alex Nicholson, a former Army intelligence officer discharged for being gay, told CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"I knew I was gay going in, and I knew about 'don't ask, don't tell,' but you know, 'don't ask, don't tell' as a sound bite sounds very reasonable. It sounds like nobody will inquire as to your sexual orientation -- as long as you don't throw it in anyone's face, you won't have a problem. \"But after I got in, I realized that 'don't ask, don't tell' was much more all-inclusive and all-encompassing,\" said Nicholson, who now is the executive director of Servicemembers United, an advocacy group that opposes the policy. \"It was more like 'don't ask, don't tell, don't happen to be found out any time, any place, in any way.' \" After about a year, Nicholson said his sexual orientation was found out within his unit. \"That information spread, and then the command was forced into a corner in which they had to discharge me,\" he said. Watch Nicholson talk about his experience . Since the policy was implemented, more than 13,500 service members have been discharged, according to Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia. In 2009, there were 428 discharges under the policy -- the lowest rate of discharge since implementation of the policy, he said. The highest year was 2001, with 1,227 discharges, he said. \"This shows that during wartime, DADT is not being pursued aggressively because one's orientation has nothing to do with their ability to fight,\" Moran said in a written statement Monday. Defense officials have said privately that the will to enforce the law is declining. Another military official familiar with the discussion said some of the issues to be considered by the military include the cost of implementing a new policy, benefits for gay spouses, potential hate crimes, and even logistical questions such as the possible need to renovate barracks to separate straight and gay troops. According to the official, separate housing or showers were not considered serious possibilities, but would be discussed in order to be ruled out. Nicholson acknowledged there are legitimate concerns, but said some of the issues raised, such as showers and housing, are merely delaying tactics used to mask \"reasons that people really don't want to see this happen.\" At least one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  -- Gen. James Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps -- has expressed reservations in the past about repealing the law. \"Our Marines are currently engaged in two fights, and our focus should not be drawn away from those priorities,\" Conway said in November through a spokesman. Watch how Joint Chiefs are dealing with the change . Most of the committee's Republicans strongly criticized a potential repeal Tuesday. \"Elections have consequences,\" said Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, referencing Obama's promise to end the policy. But \"we'll have a debate about this.\" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a former Navy pilot, said one of the keys to U.S. military power is \"good order and unit cohesion, and ... any practice which puts those goals at unacceptable risk can be restricted.\" McCain argued that while \"don't ask, don't tell\" has not been perfect, it has been effective. \"It has helped to balance a potentially disruptive tension between the desires of a minority and the broader interests of our all-volunteer force,\" he said. \"It is well understood and predominantly supported by our fighting men and women. It reflects, as I understand them, the preferences of our uniformed services ... while still allowing gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country in uniform.\" But other military veterans support the change. Retired Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said it is time to repeal the law. \"As a nation built on the [principle] of equality, we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger, more cohesive military,\" Shalikashvili wrote in a letter to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who supports repealing the policy. Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institute said the real test will be in the barracks, with the rank-and-file members of the military. \"We can talk about this delicately or we can just be fairly direct,\" O'Hanlon said. \"There are a lot of 18-year-old, old-fashioned, testosterone-laden men in the military who are tough guys. They're often politically old-fashioned or conservative; they are not necessarily at the vanguard, in many cases, of accepting alternative forms of lifestyle.\" Nicholson predicted the matter will become a \"non-issue,\" saying his organization knows of gays serving openly in the military now. Asked whether he would return to the military if the policy is repealed, Nicholson said he would not hesitate and that he has wanted to return since his discharge in 2002. \"I speak five languages, including Arabic,\" he said. \"There's nothing more that I'd love than to go back right now.\" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.", "reference": "NEW: Most Republicans on Senate panel oppose repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\"\nJoint Chiefs boss says letting gays and lesbians serve openly is \"right thing to do\"\nDefense secreatry: As change is phased in, enforcement of policy to be \"fairer\"\nImplementation plan for ending the old policy due by end of year, says Robert Gates ."}
{"id": 15017, "article": "(CNN) -- The astounding discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang has earned three scientists the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Tuesday. The discovery turned the world of physics and astronomy on its head when it was first reported in 1998 by competing teams of scientists, two from the United States and one from Australia. It helped lead scientists to the conclusion that nearly three-fourths of the universe is made up of \"dark energy,\" a mysterious force that seems to be staying gravity's hand in stopping the universe from expanding forever. The nature and role of that force has become what the Nobel organization described as one of the most enigmatic mysteries of modern physics. Half of the Noble award will go to Saul Perlmutter from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley. The other half was awarded to Brian P. Schmidt of Australian National University and Adam G. Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The prize in physics is worth 10 million Swedish kronor, about $1.44 million. \"I am delighted, excited, and deeply honored,\" Perlmutter said in a written statement. Reiss called the project \"an incredibly exciting adventure\" in a statement issued by Johns Hopkins University. \"I am deeply honored that this work has been recognized.\" he said. The two teams, working separately, each measured the light coming from a specific kind of exploding star, or supernova, in what began as an effort to confirm expectations that the expansion of the universe was slowing down. Instead, they found that the exploding stars they were using as galactic yardsticks were dimmer than they had expected, indicating that the galaxies containing them were racing away from each other and the rest of the universe at an accelerating rate. The widely celebrated discovery indicated that a mysterious and invisible form of energy is counteracting the force of gravity, pushing matter apart at an ever faster rate. \"Today, we know that 74 percent of the universe consists of this dark energy,\" Riess wrote on his website before the award was announced. \"Understanding its nature remains one of the most pressing tasks for physicists and astronomers alike.\" The discovery means that the universe is likely to continue expanding indefinitely, instead of reaching a steady state or collapsing back in on itself in what some call a \"big crunch.\" \"The findings of the 2011 Nobel Laureates in Physics have helped to unveil a universe that to a large extent is unknown to science. And everything is possible again,\" the academy said in announcing the prize. The Nobel Prize in Physics is the second of six Nobel prizes to be announced this month. Last year, professors Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester in England won the physics prize for \"groundbreaking\" experiments with the two-dimensional material graphene. Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physics 104 times. The youngest recipient was Lawrence Bragg, who won in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg is not only the youngest physics laureate, he is also the youngest laureate in any Nobel prize area. The oldest physics laureate was Raymond Davis Jr., who was 88 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2002. In the coming days, the committee will announce prizes in chemistry, literature, economics and peace. On Monday, the Nobel committee named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The announcement came three days after Steinman died of pancreatic cancer at age 68. Nobel rules don't allow awards to be given posthumously, but the Nobel Assembly issued a statement after the award was announced saying it interprets the rule to mean that no one can be deliberately given the award after death. Since the group's members did not know of Steinman's death when they made the decision, the award will stand, the assembly said.", "reference": "NEW: Winners say they are \"deeply honored\"\nSaul Perlmutter, Brian P.

Facing jail: Kamran Ajaib used Y-fronts to clean his premises, Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol . A meat distributor supplied up to 30 tons of filthy chicken to takeaways every week from an unlicensed processing plant - which had no knife steriliser or hand-washing basin. Kamran Ajaib, 27, used Y-front underpants to clean his premises, Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol, which operated as a makeshift butcher’s, Bristol Crown Court heard yesterday. The chicken was distributed to kebab shops and  takeaway restaurants across the city - and even as far afield as Swindon, Cardiff and Swansea. Council officials raided the plant after a customer found metal wire in their takeaway chicken. Ajaib’s premises had none of the necessary food hygiene approvals or licences to work with meat. He pleaded guilty to 16 charges of failing to comply with food hygiene regulations between June 2010 and May 2011, but denied any knowledge of cutting chicken on the premises. He told a previous hearing, held at the city’s magistrate’s court last year, that the chicken arrived in boxes from European Union-regulated factories and was left in those boxes. But city council principal environmental health officer John Barrow said equipment used in meat preparation had been found during a raid on the premises, along with off-cuts of meat. Mr Barrow said council officers and police found work tables, a saw often used to cut meat, knives, and a chainmail glove - used by butchers to prevent accidental injuries while chopping meat. Open wheelie bins containing meat debris and bones were also discovered in the search. Council investigators estimated the unit processed ‘in excess of 20 to 30 tons a week’ of chicken. Hygiene issue: The court heard that the pants were clean and came from a next door business, which had a surplus of old stock, and had been used as cleaning cloths at the chicken plant . Dirty gloves: The chicken was distributed to takeaway restaurants and kebab shops across Bristol and even as far afield as Swindon, Cardiff and Swansea . The court was also shown a photograph of a box of meat with a pair of underpants draped over it. It heard that the pants were clean and came from a next door business, which had a surplus of old stock, and had been used as cleaning cloths at the chicken plant. Bristol City Council successfully applied for an order from magistrates to destroy more than four tons of chicken seized in a raid on the unit in May last year. Mr Barrow said a member of the public complained to the council after finding a piece of metal wire in a chicken takeaway. A council probe into the takeaway’s suppliers led them to Hamza Poultry. From mobile phones and receipts seized in the raid they realised the meat was being distributed across the South West to what were described in court as ‘KFC clones and kebab shops’. Needing cleaning: Bristol City Council successfully applied for an order from magistrates to destroy more than four tons of chicken seized in a raid on the unit in May last year . Premises: Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol, from which the chicken was distributed around the South West . Asked what the premises needed to comply with safety standards, Mr Barrow said it lacked washbasins by work areas, a knife steriliser and any kind of safety management system. 'It doesn’t matter whether this meat is fit for human consumption or not. It is simply because they have not got the right licences in place' Kate Burnham, Bristol City Council . Kate Burnham, who brought the application to destroy the meat on behalf of the council, said: ‘It doesn’t matter whether this meat is fit for human consumption or not. It is simply because they have not got the right licences in place.’ Ajaib told the earlier court hearing that he had stepped in at short notice to help his family, taking over the business from a brother who had been ‘locked up’ some months before the raid. He said he had not known he needed a licence, and that the equipment he had on the site had come from a butcher who owed him money.

The aforementioned trio stole the headlines by joining Chelsea, Everton and West Brom respectively in what proved to be a relatively quiet transfer window. Lennon's move to Goodison Park has been in the spotlight as the winger looked extremely grumpy after sealing a move to Everton. However will the Toffees new boy be smiling at the final whistle on Saturday evening after his new side have taken on rivals Liverpool? Here, Sportsmail focuses on the players who could make their debut this weekend. Juan Cuadrado - Aston Villa vs CHELSEA . Colombia international Juan Cuadrado completed a £26.8miillion move to Chelsea during the final day of the winter transfer window despite the deal being in the pipeline since the start of January. Cuadrado will be hoping to make his Premier League bow this weekend against Premier League strugglers Aston Villa. The 26-year-old is expected to compete with the likes of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard for a first team spot at Stamford Bridge. Juan Cuadrado joined Chelsea from Fiorentina in a £26.8million deal on transfer deadline day . Aaron Lennon - EVERTON vs Liverpool . There is no better way of making yourself an instant hero at your new side than scoring a winner against your arch-rivals. Lennon could be handed the chance to do just that if he makes it on to the Goodison Park turf against Brendan Rodgers' side. The 27-year-old will be hoping to make an immediate impression at his new side after struggling to impress Tottenham boss Pochettino. Aaron Lennon looks glum as he is presented as an Everton player after signing on loan from Tottenham . Darren Fletcher - Burnley vs WEST BROM . West Brom new boy Darren Fletcher is expected to make his first Premier League appearance since making a substitute appearance in Manchester United's 3-1 Boxing Day win against Newcastle. The former Manchester United midfielder was allowed to leave Old Trafford on a free transfer after failing to hold down a regular first team spot under Louis van Gaal. Baggies boss Tony Pulis, who is likely to throw Fletcher straight into his starting XI, made a move for the 31-year-old after the Scotland international's transfer to West Ham collapsed. West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher from Manchester United on deadline day . Gabriel Paulista - Tottenham vs ARSENAL . Gabriel Paulista could get his first taste of the north London derby on Saturday if Arsene Wenger chooses to call on his services. The former Villarreal defender may have to bide his time at the Emirates Stadium as Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny are established first-team stars. Paulista, who is likely to start on the subs' bench at White Hart Lane, is 'ready to start', according to Wenger. Gabriel Paulista poses with an Arsenal shirt as the club unveil their new centre back . Pape Souare - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE . Crystal Palace have been crying out for a new left back since the start of the season as both Joel Ward and Martin Kelly have been forced into playing out of position. Pape Soare is in line to make his Crystal Palace debut at Leicester following his transfer from Lille. The 24-year-old, who signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Selhurst Park, could replace Kelly on the left side of Palace's defence. New Eagles left back Pape Souare (left) with Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish (right) Shola Ameobi - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE . Shola Ameobi was sent off in his final Premier League appearance for Newcastle back in May 2014.

Anderson has made an instant impact at the south London outfit by scoring for Palace's development side against rivals Millwall. Keshi Anderson signed for Crystal Palace on deadline day from non-league side Barton Rovers . Jack Cork - SWANSEA vs Sunderland . Swansea boss Garry Monk used a small chunk of the money received from the sale of Wilfried Bony to sign Jack Cork from Southampton. Cork spent much of his time on the subs' bench at St Mary's due to the fine form of fellow central midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama. The 25-year-old, who started his career at Chelsea, will be desperate to start against Sunderland on Saturday.

{"id": 15023, "article": "(CNN) -- Only in the extreme world of big-mountain snowboarding could someone cheat death in an avalanche and realize it had reaffirmed their love of the powder. But perhaps it isn't surprising when Xavier de Le Rue describes his relationship with nature as a need, or a drug. It is also a synergy that provides solace in the wake of bitter disappointment, such as finding out your Winter Olympics dream is finally over. \"This huge avalanche took me 2 km down the mountain,\" the Frenchman tells CNN's Human to Hero series of the moment he feared nature had finally beaten him. \"It was one of these perfect days and you forget that in a split second, things can change radically and then, suddenly the whole mountain broke around me. \"It is a miracle that I survived because I was lying on top of six meters of snow, completely broken with blood coming out of every hole in my body and completely unconscious.\" Unsurprisingly, that near-death experience six years ago launched a wave of introspection. \"I asked myself for months whether I should keep going or not, whether what I was doing was stupid,\" the 34-year-old says. \"I realized that I loved it even more than I thought and but I've always had these rules in my head to be more scared about everything all the time, but at the same time being a lot more focused. \"I think that right now, if I am freaked out about safety I will do no compromise. If I don't feel something, I'll just go back home.\" De Le Rue's discipline is boardercross -- essentially, a race from the top of a mountain to the bottom between a clutch of snowboarders. He is a four-time world champion, a three-time winner of the overall World Cup title and has three X-Games gold medals to his name. The only thing missing from his portfolio of prizes is an Olympic medal, having fallen short in 2006 and in 2010. This particular dream is destined go unfulfilled -- after dedicating the past year of his life to making next month's Sochi Games, a mix-up over qualification points saw him fall short of the benchmark. \"It was really disappointing to get the news as this was going to be the end of my boardercross career,\" he explains. \"After four world champion titles, three X-Games medals and three crystal globes, it would have been an amazing way to leave the sport, but it has been a hell of a lot more brutal. \"The good thing about everything is that my true place in snowboarding, as well as my heart, is in the high mountains riding powder. I am more fit than ever, and I guess this blowup is a great way to start from scratch. \"I feel a lot lighter in a way, with no pressure. All that energy I have been gathering really makes me look towards my future adventures.\" There are plenty more to come. Chief among them is continuing production on his own films, with expeditions to Spitsbergen, in Norway, and Alaska scheduled, as well as a commentary stint in Sochi. Watch de Le Rue's 'Mission Antarctic' It is clear this connection de Le Rue feels with the mountains is not something that can easily be shaken. \"Snowboarding is many things for me but most of all, snowboarding is what shapes my life in a way,\" he says. \"Snowboarding is what has taught me to know myself. \"Snowboarding is what has taken me to the most glorious times of my life but also to the worst times of my life. \"I think it's just my own tool to experience life, to push myself, to know my limits, to maybe go over my limits sometimes and to be a happy and fulfilled human being. See de Le Rue take on the planet's steepest peaks . \"If I'm in a big city for a while, I start to feel nervous and I know that I need to go back somewhere where there is nothing, where I can touch a tree or a rock or something and then I feel better.\" De Le Rue thrives on the thrill of competition -- he describes boardercross as like \"motocross\" on the snow, as six people battle over a course filled with jumps and obstacles to reach the foot. But he is just as happy in splendid, snowy isolation on top of a mountain. \"You see those big mountains that are far away and so unreachable,\" he says. \"Ever since I started snowboarding and skiing, I looked at them and dreamed of getting up there and being up there on my own and even riding them. Yeah, the dream came true. \"I think if I had to describe one feeling that really stands out above everything; it's the one moment when you're at the top of the mountain, ready to drop in. \"You're on your own, you're far from everything, and you're in a really strong element. \"It's amazingly beautiful and there's something that happens in your head, it's like time doesn't matter anymore. Your daily problems just vanish and it's indescribable.\" Born in the Pyrenees, De Le Rue started skiing at the tender age of two. His four brothers and sisters also took the slopes at a young age, and his brother Paul-Henri looks set to make the French team for Sochi. But though a medal at the Games was his final wish on the competitive side of the sport, he believes boardercross has evolved into a discipline that has maybe pushed the boundaries too far. \"I think now that the sport has changed,\" he says. \"The young guys are hungry and they're willing to win at any price. \"I'm going to sound like an old wise man but I miss the good old times where we used to respect lines, where we used to have a gentleman's code. \"Right now, it's just full battle with no rules, in a way.\" But even if de Le Rue's boardercross days are over, there is plenty more big mountain snowboarding to be done. \"It's a way of kind of getting a bit of control over the mountains but still being humble, asking permission in a way to access it and to ride it and to get this huge immense pride and happiness at the bottom,\" he explained. \"Everything is recorded in your head and you just go into automatic mode. You're just in a sort of bubble and you don't feel anything, you're just like an animal. \"Once you've gone through all the hard bits and you're straight-lining down towards the end, you get this fire exploding inside you.\"", "reference": "Xavier de Le Rue is a boardercross snowboard world champion from France .\nDe Le Rue survived a near-fatal avalanche but says it galvanized his love of sport .\nThe 34-year-old narrowly missed out on a spot in the French Winter Olympics team .\nHe also tackles big-mountain challenges, including a trip to Antarctica ."}

{"id": 15025, "article": "By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . A teacher who had a major meltdown and suffered chronic depression, due to 'feral' and 'unruly' students, has been awarded almost $770,000 in damages. Peter Doulis, 48, sued the Victorian education department after he claimed he was left unable to work because he was forced to teach some of worst behaved students at Werribee secondary college between 1998 and 2004. The Supreme court ruling which was handed down Friday, could also set a precedent, and pave the way for more action against the Victorian Education department. Teacher Peter Doulis was awarded almost $770,000 in damages after he claimed he suffered major depression and a meltdown from being forced to teach some of the worst behaved students at Werribee Secondary college (pictured) between 1998 and 2004 . The Supreme court ruled in favour of a Melbourne teacher who claimed he was left unable to work after being subject to 'feral' and 'unruly' students at Werribee Secondary College between 1998 and 2004. Peter Doulis says some students would be 'virtually crawling up the wall' before his classes . The court was told, Mr Doulis was threatened while teaching at the school. ABC News reported he described how 'feral' students would be 'virtually crawling up the wall' before his classes and in one instance a student, armed with a makeshift flame thrower, singed another student's jumper. The supreme court voted in favour of the teachers claims, finding the school had breached it's duty of care to Mr Doulis. 'I find that that breach of duty was a cause of the chronic severe major depressive condition that he now has,' ABC News reported the judge saying. 'I also consider that, had Mr Doulis's workload of low classes and foundation classes been reduced, and if he had been supported in his teaching duties, then it is probable that his psychiatric condition would not have deteriorated.' Principal Kevin O'Neil commented on behalf of the school and the education department releasing a statement. 'Our school has a learning model that allocates students to classes based on their different academic achievement levels, allowing them to move up and down the levels each semester as their achievements change,' he said. 'this allows our teachers to target their teaching to the appropriate level and spend more time teaching level-appropriate content and less time addressing the varied needs of students in mixed classes.' Mr O'Neil also added that the results of the model are clearly demonstrated by the school's VCE performance, which is consistently higher than similar schools. 'Our teachers also benefit from this model. It allows them to become well rounded and dynamic.' 'All of our teachers are given classes across levels and we do not disproportionately allocate any teachers to any one level. We no longer allow teachers to request to teach at only one level.' The statement also added, quoting directly from the judgment –'The evidence at trial established that the College is now one of the finest schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne.' The Victorian Workcover Authority also commented on the ruling saying it will consider the judgement handed down in the Supreme Court. 'A decision as to whether or not the matter will be appealed will be made in due course,' said a Victorian Workcover Authority spokesperson. A separate hearing to determine compensation for future losses will be held later this month.", "reference": "Melbourne teacher Peter Doulis has been awarded nearly $770K due to 'feral' and 'unruly' kids .\nMr Doulis claims he was forced to teach the worst students at Werribee Secondary College between 1998 and 2004 .\nMr Doulis taught students with ADHD, autism and dyslexia .\nThe Supreme court ruled the school had breached its duty of care to Mr Doulis .\nThe ruling could pave the wave for extra law suits against the Victorian Education Department ."}

Hundreds of mourners, including Armstrong's family and fellow astronauts, packed the massive house of worship for a public \"celebration of (Armstrong's) life,\" three weeks after he died on August 25 at age 82. The cathedral's interim dean, the Rev. Dr. Francis H. Wade, called the ceremony an opportunity to \"give thanks for a life well-lived and service nobly rendered.\" Neil Armstrong, a hero who shunned fame . Armstrong earned his renown commanding the Apollo 11 space mission and landing on the moon on July 20, 1969, when he was 38. \"Neil will always be remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own. But it was courage, grace, and humility he displayed throughout his life that lifted him above the stars,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said at the service, about an hour before he presented Armstrong's family with the American flag that flew over Johnson Space Center on the day the space pioneer died. Bolden didn't speak just on behalf of himself and NASA. The space agency chief also relayed portions of a letter President Obama wrote to the Armstrong family, which read, in part, \"Future generations will draw inspiration from his spirit of discovery, humble composure, and pioneering leadership, in setting a bold new course for space exploration. The imprint he left on the surface of the moon, and the story of human history, is matched only by the extraordinary mark he left on the hearts of all Americans.\" Alternating between musical and prayer interludes, luminary after luminary described Armstrong as an extraordinary man who had performed extraordinary deeds, yet retained his humility and tried to diffuse the credit and fame he received among thousands of other NASA engineers, scientists, technicians and fellow astronauts. Retired Navy Capt. Eugene Cernan was the last man to walk on the moon, in December 1972, when he commanded the Apollo 17 mission. He paid homage to the founding member of his exclusive fraternity. \"He understood the immensity of what he had done. Yet Neil was always willing to give of himself,\" Cernan said, later adding, \"No one could have accepted the responsibility of his remarkable accomplishment with more dignity and more grace than Neil Armstrong. He embodied all that is good and all that is great about America.\" Treasury Secretary John Snow, a friend of Armstrong's, called him \"the most reluctant of heroes.\" \"With his uncommon humility and grace, Neil captured the very best of the American character and put it on display for the world to see,\" he said.

{"id": 15027, "article": "Farmington Hills, Michigan (CNN) -- Insane Clown Posse knows you hate them. They know you don't get their makeup, that you've never heard their songs on the radio, that their fans don't look or act like anybody else's. They're OK with that. Actually, they kind of love it. \"We may never be understood till we're dead and gone,\" Joseph Bruce, known as Violent J, said last month, sitting among stacks of vinyl in the band's warehouse outside Detroit. \"Once we're gone, people will take a look at the whole picture and say, 'What the f*** was that?'\" For now, though, they're not OK with anybody taunting or discriminating against their fans, known as Juggalos. ICP founders Bruce and Joseph Utsler, or Shaggy 2 Dope, announced last weekend they plan to file a lawsuit against the FBI for labeling their fans a gang. They made the announcement during the Gathering of the Juggalos, an annual music festival that draws thousands of ICP fans to rural Cave-In-Rock, Illinois. Watch: Insane Clown Posse to sue FBI . \"This is the government's way of telling us what you can listen to, what you can wear,\" Violent J told a crowd in a video posted online. \"They're telling you that 'if you listen to this music and you support this music, you are going to be committing a crime in our eyes.'\" An Insane Clown Posse spokeswoman said the band's lawyers are deciding how to proceed, but they are asking Juggalos to visit juggalosfightback.com to report \"any negative consequence with an employer or governmental representative, including law enforcement, border patrol, airline security, or other local, state or federal governmental agency or employee as a result of their status as a Juggalo.\" The FBI called Juggalos a \"hybrid gang\" in its 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment, a designation ICP's members call \"insanely ridiculous.\" The report mentions a January 2011 case in which a \"suspected Juggalo member\" shot a couple in King County, Washington, and a January 2010 case in which two \"suspected Juggalo associates\" beat and robbed an elderly man. \"Most crimes committed by Juggalos are sporadic, disorganized, individualistic, and often involve simple assault, personal drug use and possession, petty theft, and vandalism,\" the FBI report said. \"However, open source reporting suggests that a small number of Juggalos are forming more organized subsets and engaging in more gang-like criminal activity, such as felony assaults, thefts, robberies, and drug sales.\" That's not how Violent Jay and Shaggy 2 Dope see it: \"At any of our shows, it's all love, total strangers high-fiving,\" Violent J said. \"It's the camaraderie that can't be defined or explained.\" The ICP founders have seen their fans act out. At the 2010 Gathering, Juggalos lobbed rocks and bottles at singer and former Playboy model Tila Tequila, leaving her bloodied and bruised. Shaggy and Violent J take some of the blame; they say they shouldn't have invited her to the Gathering, and when they realized how negative the reaction would be, they asked her not to take the stage. Tequila was injured, they said, because she insulted the Juggalos, then wouldn't leave the stage. Even after the onslaught of press coverage that followed, they do not blame their fans. From the archives: Tila Tequila wants to end juggalos gathering . \"Juggalos come from all walks of life, man,\" Violent J said. \"This is an acquired taste, what we do. We're not on the radio. It's not something where you're going to pull up at a red light and the dude next to you is going to be bumping our s***, too... Our fans like a little background, a little story. They don't want to see us wearing what they're wearing. They want to see us jump out with fire and f****** strobe lights and confetti. \"They bought a ticket, they want to see the circus.\" Starting in the 1990s, the self-dubbed \"scrubs\" quietly amassed a devoted following of fans that spans ages and backgrounds. If there's a common theme among them, it's this: The fans were outsiders who finally found a community in the hip-hop, wrestling, Faygo pop-loving pack of 'los and 'lettes. They rely on their label, Psychopathic Records, and the devotion of their fans, to advertise and distribute their music. News of the possible lawsuit came days before the release of the band's new album, \"The Mighty Death Pop,\" a multiyear effort with editions that include cover tunes that originated with Michael Jackson, Christina Aguilera and \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\" \"We're really high on things right now, not substance-ly high. We're high on ourselves right now,\" Violent J said. \"I know we're a joke to the mainstream world, but the love we get from our fans is solid and real.\" They say the new album is their best work, an album of songs that took years to write and record. With so many fans, it's not the same as it was in the early years when they boasted and lied about who they were and what they were about. They can't even remember why, only that they saw themselves more as actors than artists. They still love wrestling and rap, but they started getting real about a message after Violent J's 2003 autobiography, \"Behind the Paint,\" a book he said exposed the dark truths about divorce, abuse, poverty and drugs in his life. \"We came from broken homes, but it almost feels stupid to sit here and talk about that because we had a great childhood,\" Violent J said. \"My childhood was incredibly awesome, filled with imagination, fun, adventure...\" \"Backyard wrestling,\" Shaggy added. From the archives: Charlie Sheen heckled by Juggalos . \"The poorer I was,\" Violent J continued, \"that made me who I am today. Nowadays, it doesn't take a lot to impress me because I never had s***, you know what I mean?\" \"We got to be broke as you can possibly be together, and we got to appreciate everything that happened since then together... Not a day goes by we don't sit there and analyze this, and say, 'Man, you know, we're living our dream.' \"We still get to hang out with the same people we hung out with when we were 15 and 16. They work in this building. We get to travel the world with them. And most people you know, they have their high school years, their college people, and after that, they become family people. That's all gravy, but they can't say they don't dream about what it was like when they were running around with all their friends.\" After 20 years, they said they're just hitting their stride. They're sober, and never got into hard drugs, they said, but both talked about medication to stabilize their moods, to keep the pressure from overwhelming them, to keep them away from bad habits from the past. \"I love coming up here and doing what we do, then I love going home,\" Shaggy said, holding an electronic cigarette. \"It's such a blessed life.\" They say they'll keep going \"till the wheels fall off.\" \"Some people listening actually give a f*** about what we have to say and that feels good. I can't front about that. It feels good to have people care what's on your mind,\" Violent J said. \"We get to rock stages. I've f***** some beautiful women in my life. Straight up, two or three chicks at once. Who gets to do that s***, man? Especially scrubs?\" Want to see the real ICP?

{"id": 15028, "article": "(CNN) -- France's far-right National Front has won a nationwide election for the first time, as far-right parties across Europe caused a political \"earthquake,\" with a string of victories in voting for the European Parliament. The National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, notched up 24.95% of the vote in France, according to official estimates, well ahead of mainstream parties UMP and the Socialist Party. Le Pen said the win showed that people want to see change in Europe. France's Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the result was \"more than a warning. It is a shock, an earthquake.\" Right-wing parties also gained ground in the UK, Denmark and Austria, according to projections posted on the European Parliament's official elections website. Voters across Europe have been casting ballots for days in the parliamentary vote. There are 751 seats from 28 countries up for grabs. With most of the ballots counted, provisional results indicate that left-center and right-center parties will still hold a majority of seats in the European Parliament, which plays a key role in shaping European laws and will weigh in on who the European Commission's next President should be. But right-wing parties and other so-called Euroskeptic groups who oppose the European Union are gaining ground, said Simon Usherwood, an expert on European politics at the University of Surrey. \"I think what's really changed is you're seeing a lot more groups on the edges, particularly with the far right, who are going to be much more of a feature of the next five years of the parliament,\" he said. So what does that mean? \"They don't have enough votes to stop legislation going through,\" Usherwood told CNN, \"but what they will get, particularly on the far right, is the time for speaking in debates, the chairmanship of certain committees, which means that they're going to have much more of a platform on which they can sell their message to voters.\" In France, which has 74 seats in the European Parliament, the National Front won 24.95% of votes, according to official estimates, coming in ahead of the center-right UMP, which scored 20.8%, and President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, which came in third with 14%. Even though the vote was for a regional legislative body, the potential impact on France's national political landscape was clear on Sunday. The results sparked stunned reactions from some French politicians and triumphant victory speeches from others. PM Valls described the election as \"a very serious moment for France and for Europe,\" noting that projections indicate that voters are skeptical of the European Union. \"None of us can shirk their responsibilities,\" he said, according to a summary of his remarks posted on the French government's website. Meanwhile, National Front leader Marine Le Pen said the results showed that French voters wanted more control. \"The sovereign people have proclaimed that they want to take back the reigns of their destiny into their hands. Our people demand one type of politics: politics of the French, for the French, with the French. They no longer want to be directed from outside,\" she said. She said the vote shows that President Francois Hollande should dissolve France's parliament, where most lawmakers come from mainstream political parties. Nearly 400 million Europeans were eligible to vote in the parliamentary elections. Turnout was just over 43%, slightly higher than it was during the last vote in 2009, Parliament spokesman Jaume Duch said. \"The clear message here is that people are unhappy with the way mainstream political parties have handled the economic crisis, and they're giving them a good kicking,\" said Petros Fassoulas, chairman of the pro-Europe European Movement. Before the election, analysts predicted that protest parties were likely to triumph at the polls. Those parties are demanding tighter border controls, nationalized decision-making and a dissolution of the currency union. But they have little in common aside from a dislike of the Brussels bureaucracy, so it's difficult for them to find much common ground, Usherwood said. \"They can agree they don't like the EU,\" Usherwood said, \"but they can't agree what they like and what the answer is.\" CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Jim Bittermann, Ivana Kottasova, Jonathan Mann and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.", "reference": "NEW: Vote shows the French \"no longer want to be directed from the outside,\" Le Pen says .\n\"The result is a shock, an earthquake,\" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says .\nFrance's far-right National Front party poised to win a nationwide vote for the first time .\nVoters across Europe have been casting ballots for 751 seats from 28 countries ."}
{"id": 15029, "article": "Celebrities, MPs and charities have joined the backlash against the latest Band Aid single, claiming it ‘patronises’ Africa. As the new version of Do They Know It’s Christmas? reached number one in the charts, the furore over its controversial lyrics grew. Lily Allen and Emeli Sande are the latest musicians to criticise the song, which aims to raise millions of pounds to help fight the ebola crisis in West Africa. Some say the lyrics are outdated and perpetuate negative stereotypes of African countries which could harm their world image. Scroll down for video . Lily Allen (left) and Emeli Sande are the latest musicians to criticise the song, which aims to raise millions of pounds to help fight the ebola crisis in West Africa . Miss Sande, who was one of only three black musicians to take part in the new single, praised the sentiment behind the project but said ‘a whole new’ song was needed. The 27-year-old, who has Zambian heritage, said on Twitter both she and Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo ‘made and sang our own edits’, and it was ‘unfortunate’ none made the cut. She added: ‘I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control.’ Lily Allen also said yesterday she refused to take part in the project because she felt there was ‘something smug about it’. She added: ‘I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that.’ Blur frontman Damon Albarn also appeared to criticise the project, saying ‘really sometimes, giving money creates another problem’. He added: ‘Our perspective and our idea of what helps and our idea [of] what’s wrong and right are not necessarily shared by other cultures.’ Stellar line-up: Band Aid 30 artists have recorded a new version of the song Do They Know It's Christmas? Damon Albarn (left) appeared to criticise the project and Sir Malcolm Bruce MP told BBC Radio 4: ‘Africa isn’t a country' No go: Adele 'ignored' Bob Geldof's pleas to sing on the Band Aid 30 Christmas charity single . Fuse ODG says he pulled out of recording the Band Aid 30 charity single because he feels it's a quick fix to a larger problem. He also criticised some of the lyrics . The single, which features stars including One Direction, U2 frontman Bono and Ellie Goulding, was originally released in 1984 to raise money to fight famine in Ethiopia. Critics said it was inappropriate to use the same song – brought to public attention once more by its original creators, Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure – for a different crisis. It has also been pointed out that many of those affected by ebola are Muslim and do not celebrate Christmas. Others complained the song’s revised lyrics, which include the line ‘there’s death in every tear’, paint Africa in a negative light. Sir Malcolm Bruce MP, chairman of the International Development Select Committee and deputy Lib Dem leader, told BBC Radio 4: ‘Africa isn’t a country, it’s a continent with many different countries with many different challenges. Sir Bob Geldof, 63, (pictured with Midge Ure) has called claims the song is patronising a ‘complete load of b*******’ ‘There’s a danger that this kind of appeal is slightly patronising and gives the impression that Africa doesn’t have the capacity to do things for itself.’ Solome Lemma, co-founder of Africans in the Diaspora and the Africa Responds initiative on ebola, told Al Jazeera the original song ‘created misconceptions about Ethiopia in a patronising way’. And Dawit Gebreselassie, 26, a financial analyst from Ethiopia, joked: ‘I would ask, does Geldof know when it’s Christmas time in Ethiopia? ‘Perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on January 7 could have misled him into thinking we don’t know when it is. ‘Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don’t need any more prompting.’ Despite the backlash, the single has sold 312,000 copies since its release last week. Sir Bob, 63, has called claims the song is patronising a ‘complete load of b*******’.", "reference": "Lily Allen and Emeli Sande are the latest musicians to criticise the song .\nSome say the lyrics perpetuate negative stereotypes of African countries .\nSir Bob Geldof has called the criticism a 'complete load of b*******'"}
{"id": 15030, "article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Health officials expect more than 3 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine to be available in the first week of October. Three flu shot manufacturers were licensed by the FDA last week. \"3.4 million doses of vaccines will be available,\" said Dr. Jay Butler, who heads the 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Task Force at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"All of that vaccine is the inhalable vaccine,\" he said Friday. That form of vaccine is marketed in the United States as FluMist and is approved only for healthy individuals between the ages of 2 and 49. Pregnant women are not allowed to get this type of vaccine because it contains a live virus. Butler added that he thinks there some flu shots may be available in early October as well, but he had a hard number only for the inhalable vaccine. Flu shots contain an \"inactivated,\" or dead, virus.  Take a quiz about the H1N1 flu » . The 3.4 million doses of vaccine that will be shipped at the beginning of October are the first of 195 million doses the U.S. government has purchased from five vaccine manufacturers, Butler said. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration licensed the vaccine from four of those companies. Sanofi Pasteur, Novartis and CSL Limited all manufacture flu shots, and MedImmune manufactures the inhalable vaccine. GlaxoSmithkline, which also is producing injectable flu vaccine, still needs to have its vaccine approved by the agency. Health officials report that the new H1N1 flu virus has not changed from what was seen earlier this year, so they are expecting the vaccine to be very effective. In some parts of the country, the vaccine can't some soon enough. The deputy director of the CDC's Influenza Division, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, said 21 states are now reporting widespread flu activity. \"It's a very strange thing for us to see that amount of influenza at this time of year\" rather than much later in the flu season. Jernigan said there's been only a small an increase in hospitalizations, mainly among young children and adults. But there has been a lot of activity in outpatient settings.  Watch a report on the surprising spread of flu » . Until the vaccine becomes available, health officials have recommended steps that people can take to cut their chance of getting sick or, for those already sick, prevent the spread of the flu, including frequent handwashing, sneezing into a tissue or sleeve rather than into one's hand, and staying home when sick. Those who are at the highest risk of getting seriously ill -- pregnant women, children, young adults and people with chronic lung or heart disease or diabetes -- should be the first to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus. Health care workers and emergency medical personnel are also encouraged be vaccinated early. \"Our goal is to ultimately make the vaccine available to every American who wishes to be vaccinated,\" Butler said. \"The vaccine demand is hard to predict.\" Learn more about the H1N1 flu from the CDC . According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll conducted in late August, 66 percent of Americans plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu. Health care workers may not necessarily be among them. In the past, only about 40 percent of health care workers have been vaccinated against flu, according to the CDC.", "reference": "Inhalable vaccine available only between ages 2 and 49; not for pregnant women .\nSome flu shots will be available in early October as well .\nNew H1N1 has not changed much from earlier virus, officials say .\n21 states are now reporting widespread flu activity ."}

Its accidental discovery by a dredger led to six years of underwater investigations, which prompted experts to hail the find as the most significant since the Mary Rose. Here, archaeologist David Parham from Bournemouth University inspects the carving . Marine archaeologists from Bournemouth University have already recovered scores of artefacts from the vessel that is known as the Swash Channel Wreck after the area of sea where it sunk. And after being given a grant of £500,000 from English Heritage, the team today completed the recovery of the five tonne wooden rudder that had become separated from the main hull. Last month divers spent seven days digging the rudder from out of the sea bed and placing a large steel frame around it, similar to the operation that raised the Mary Rose in 1982.

The baroque facial carving on the end of the rudder shows a military man wearing a classical helmet.It will be constantly sprayed with special chemicals for the next two years to help conserve it. The rudder will then put on display at Poole Museum alongside other artifacts recovered from the wreckage. The rudder is being temporarily stored at Poole docks, before being transported to York. It was towed four miles into Poole Harbour where today it was hoisted onto the quayside (pictured) by a crane in front of the excited team of archaeologists . Dave Parham, a senior lecturer in marine archaeology at Bournemouth University, said: 'Before now we had just seen the rudder underwater where you could only make out a few feet of it at a time. 'So to see it in day light in all its glory is really quite spectacular. 'It is a very large and impressive item itself so you can imagine how spectacular this merchant vessel would have looked. 'Its discovery is an extremely significant one and has given way to one of the largest shipwreck investigations within the UK.' Another carving previously discovered at the wreck of the Dutch trading ship near Poole, Dorset . Unlike the Mary Rose, little is known of the Swash Channel Wreck, including its identity. Tests on the oak wood from it have dated the felling of the timber to 1628 and from forests on the Dutch/German border. Analysis of some of the recovered artefacts date to the middle of the 17th century. This has led the experts to believe the vessel was an armed Dutch trading ship that was either going to or returning from the Mediterranean or the Far East. Analysis of some of the recovered artefacts date to the middle of the 17th century. This has led experts to believe the vessel was an armed Dutch trading ship . It is thought it hit a sandbank in the approaches to Poole Harbour and water flooded its bilges. The ship is then believed to have rolled over and sunk in 22ft of water. Mr Parham said: 'It would have been a very big vessel for its day and the whole vessel would have been a spectacular work or art. 'It was a sign of prestige and wealth. It was making a statement, showing how great and wonderful the owners were. Mr Parham said the ship could be compared to a 17th century version of the luxurious Titanic liner, although the Titanic was ornate for passengers, and not just for those viewing the ship. A carving of a merman is pictured (right) and (wreckage) left . 'They would have been a large Dutch conglomerate, similar to the East India Company. 'It would not have been a million miles from a 17th century version of the Titanic, although the Titanic was ornate for the passengers and not for those on the outside.

Archaeologists believe the ship was a sign of prestige and wealth. It was making a statement, showing how great and wonderful the owners were by including lavish baroque carvings such as the one pictured, for example . 'It was either going out or coming back when it sank outside of Poole Harbour. 'We have received a grant to fund the recovery all the material that is at risk of erosion.' So far the team has brought up artefacts including five baroque carvings, ceramic pieces, leather shoes, copper and pewter plates and cups and a bronze compass divider. They have also recovered animal bones of sheep and cows that would have fed the crew. Mr Parnam (pictured) said he has no idea who the male carving on the rudder might be but thinks as it is a moustachioed man with a classical helmet on, it is depicting a military man of some sort . Mr Parham said: 'Last month we spent seven days excavating beneath the rudder in order to put strops around it and lift it into a steel frame. 'It was then moved four miles to the quayside in Poole and lifted out of the water today. 'We have no idea who the male carving on the rudder might be. It is a moustachioed man with a classical helmet on so it is depicting a military man of some sort.' About 40 per cent of the port side of the wreck lies intact on the sea bed but it will be too costly an operation to recover that.

A former CNN employee who enjoyed wearing brightly colored clothes to work and also mariachi uniforms has launched a $60 million discrimination lawsuit after he fired last June. William Kane claims that he was let go from the news station's New York operation after his sexuality became common knowledge. According to his lawsuit, Kane's claims that although he had always dressed in a colorful manner it only became a problem once bosses heard about his same-sex engagement. William Kane, pictured alongside Christine Amanpour, claims he had always worn bright colors to work and that it only became an issue after he revealed his same-sex engagement and so his boss learned of his sexuality . Kane worked at CNN for over 10 years and claims for the majority of that time no one ever complained about his wardrobe which included a hot pink shirt, bright red track jacket, neon green soccer jersey and a yellow track suit with matching shoes and hat. The lawsuit states that after Kane's supervisor John Silva learned that he was gay, his workplace environment became hostile, reports the New York Daily News. He alleges that Silva told him he didn't want him to wear either his black or yellow mariachi suits 'because it was too flamboyant for a male in our department.' Silva runs the technical operations department and suggested to Kane that he might be better suited in the 'entertainment or make-up department.' In his lawsuit, Kane claims he was told that presenters including Erin Burnett, center, and Pier Morgan, right, had complained about his clothes, but when he was spoke to them they denied having a problem . Kane claims he was singled out, despite the fact that the department had had a tradition of wearing colorful shirts on Thursdays between 2002 and 2008. During Kane's CNN career he worked alongside presenters including Christine Amanpour, Piers Morgan and Erin Burnett. In his lawsuit he claims that a supervisor offered him $100 to buy something from TJ Maxx after former presenter Piers Morgan had complained that Kane's blue track suit was too distracting. Kane refused the money and put a black CNN sweatshirt over the track suit. When he later confronted Morgan about the issue, the British journalist denied that it had been an issue. Another time Kane claims he was ordered to change out of a white suit and red tie because Erin Burnett considered it 'too flashy'. She denied to his face making any such comment. Kane said he complained to the human resources department about his treatment, but then he was cited for nitpicking violations.", "reference": "William Kane claims he had always worn bright colors to work, but it only became an issue after he revealed his same-sex engagement .\nHis boss warned him not to wear either his black or yellow mariachi suits 'because it .\nwas too flamboyant for a male in our department'\nKane was told presenters including Piers Morgan and Erin Burnett had complained about his 'distracting' wardrobe .\nBoth denied making any such remarks when he approached them .\nKane is seeking $60 million in his discrimination lawsuit ."}

Malala, the Pakistani girl who made a miraculous recovery after being shot in the head by the Taliban, said women are targeted by those who fear a society in which women are empowered. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls, an act that has become the focal point of a worldwide social media campaign demanding their return. The Malala Fund is launching a Nigerian girls education campaign around the issue. The 16-year-old human rights advocate first spoke up about the kidnappings last week. \"When I heard about girls in Nigeria being abducted, I felt very sad, and I thought, 'my sisters are imprisoned now,'\" Malala said. \"The girls in Nigeria are my sisters and its my responsibility that I speak up for my sisters.\" Boko Haram are extremists who don't understand Islam, she said. The religion, she says, calls for empowerment through education, not a snuffing of it. \"They should go and they should learn Islam, and I think that they should think of these girls as their own sisters. How can one imprison their own sisters and treat them in such a bad way?\" she said. Everyone should speak up for the kidnapped girls, she said. In a photo released on social media, Malala holds a sign reading #BringBackOurGirls, joining the chorus of social media activity repeating the same demand. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been under fire over accusations the government initially ignored and then later downplayed the abduction of the girls.

{"id": 15035, "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Global warming concerns took center stage Monday as two organizations held rallies to draw attention to an issue that President Barack Obama has promised to place near the top of his agenda. Demonstrators stand outside the Capitol Power Plant in Washington on Monday to protest the plant's use of coal. A group of young protesters gathered in front of the Capitol to rally on behalf of legislation to reduce carbon emissions, decrease dependence on coal and oil, and speed a national drive toward \"clean\" energy. Later Monday, hundreds of representatives of a coalition of environmental, public health, social justice and other advocacy organizations marched around Capitol Hill and encircled a Washington coal-fired power plant to highlight the issue of climate change. The group, protesting the Capitol Power Plant's use of coal, stood in front of the plant's gated entrances. The plant powers the heating and cooling systems in the Capitol, as well as roughly a dozen other federal office buildings on Capitol Hill. \"The Capitol Power Plant, sitting just blocks from Capitol Hill, symbolizes the stranglehold coal has over our government and future,\" the group said on its Web site. \"It's not the largest or the dirtiest power plant in the country, but as the plant that is actually run by and for Congress it serves as an incredibly iconic symbol of what is wrong with our country's energy and climate policy.\" No arrests were made as a result of the protest, which \"didn't affect the operations of the power plant,\" Capitol police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released a letter Thursday calling for the plant to convert to 100 percent natural gas by the end of 2009. \"Taking this major step toward cleaning up the Capitol Power Plant's emissions would be an important demonstration of Congress' willingness to deal with the enormous challenges of global warming, energy independence and our inefficient use of finite fossil fuels,\" they wrote. Several members of Congress and environmental leaders addressed the earlier rally, which was held at the conclusion to Power Shift '09, a four-day environmental summit organized by the Energy Action Coalition. The coalition describes itself as an umbrella organization of 700 groups fighting for \"clean energy solutions and the creation of a new green economy.\" It's time to \"turn up the political heat in Washington so we can turn down the heat on Mother Earth,\" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told the crowd. \"The science tells us that the time for talking about this problem is over.

{"id": 15036, "article": "Arsene Wenger admits that the traditional, powerful English defender has become a dying breed – not just at Arsenal but throughout the Premier League. Better pitches and a more cultivated approach to training in youth academies might have killed off the old-fashioned English centre-half in the tradition of Tony Adams, Martin Keown and Wenger’s current assistant, Steve Bould. Indeed Wenger believes John Terry may be the last of a generation raised to defend aggressively – but he insists he still has hopes that his own troubled back four will eventually match the great Arsenal defensive teams of the past. John Terry is the last of the traditional English central defenders, according to Arsene Wenger . Terry rises above Moussa Sissoko to head during Chelsea's 2-0 win over Newcastle on Saturday . Wenger, whose team take on Stoke today, having lost 3-2 in a particularly calamitous defensive performance last month at the Britannia Stadium, said: ‘Young boys practice well on quality pitches, whereas before it was muddy and you could tackle and throw your body in - it created opportunities for defenders to work naturally on their defensive techniques. Today it's all more standing up there is less physical commitment because the quality of the pitches are much better. ‘The game has become more technical. You find more players who may have good technique. Maybe as well our societies are less aggressive. In the football education . System, you cultivate that intense desire less. It's more about the quality of the technique and maybe that creates fewer defenders.’ Asked whether the likes of Terry were the last of that kind of defender, Wenger said: ‘John Terry is a coach on the pitch. He's a Tony Adams, basically, (who) organises the team, because he has huge experience now and because he reads the game well. 'Maybe Gary Cahill in five, six, seven years will be like that as well. He is the right age, and you do not find many any more. You had more before than you do today.’ Arsenal boss Wenger with former captain Tony Adams lifting the Premiership trophy in 1998 . Wenger believes that Chelsea's Gary Cahill could also be on the same level as the likes of Terry and Adams . And Wenger concedes that developing communication between a multi-cultural back four has proved much more difficult than in the days when he had Englishmen Adams and Bould at centre half with Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon at full back. ‘Certainly, you had more (leaders) before,’ said Wenger. ‘If you look at the evolution of English football, when I arrived here, the back four all was English. They were not only English, they communicated because they had the same culture, the same way to see the game, they were educated together and communication is an important part. ‘With people coming in from different countries, communication has gone from the back four, much more than before, and you see less people who talk. It doesn’t mean there are no leaders but they do not speak always the same language, they are not the same way to respond to situations. That has a little bit gone in our game.’ Arsenal's legendary central defensive partnership of Steve Bould (left) and Adams . Wenger believes that current partnership Laurent Koscielny (left) and Per Mertesacker can reach their level . That said, Wenger’s greatest back four, in the 1998-99 season, which conceded just 17 goals, finished second to Manchester United in the Premier League. Wenger always remains peeved that no-one refers to his own creation, the Invincible back four of Lauren, Sol Campbell, Kolo Toure and Ashley Cole, which conceded 26 goals in their unbeaten season of 2003-04. ‘We had a great defence after that, nobody spoke about that: the Invincible team. They were physically fantastic. Lauren, Kolo, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole was a top back four.’ And Wenger remains convinced that the current back four of Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny, Per Mertesacker and Kieran Gibbs can still become a unit that could compare with those teams. ‘I think we are not far. We are getting there. It’s not only [that], I think we have more offensive players in midfield than we had at the time. It’s not only the back four, I think the whole defensive unit, we are more offensively oriented than we were at that time.’", "reference": "Traditional powerful English defenders are dying out, says Arsene Wenger .\nArsenal boss believes John Terry is last of his kind in his generation .\nWenger also concedes developing multi-cultural defence is far more difficult than when he had an all-English back four .\nConvinced that Arsenal's current back four can rival his great defences ."}

A widow has been told for the second time by a Pennsylvania court that her home's sale at auction after she failed to pay property taxes is valid - she owed only $6.30 at the time it was sold. Eileen Battisti, 53, of Aliquippa, lost legal rights to her $280,000 home over two years ago after failing to pay the paltry sum but has made multiple appeals on grounds she did not know it was owed. The most recent decision made last week denied her request to reverse the September 2011 sale of a house she is still reportedly living in. 'I paid everything, and didn't know about the $6.30,' Battisti said. 'For the house to be sold just because of $6.30 is crazy.' She had previously owed . other taxes, the court noted, but at the time of the sale she owed just $235, including . other interest and fees. Beaver County Common Pleas Judge Gus . Kwidis wrote in his ruling that the county tax claim bureau complied with notification . requirements in state law before the auction. 'There is no doubt that (she) had actual receipt of the notification of the tax upset sale on July 7, 2011, and Aug. 16, 2011,' the judge wrote. 'Moreover, on Aug. 12, 2011, a notice of sale was sent by first class mail and was not returned.' Battisti also admitted to receiving those notices, the judge asserted, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He write in the ruling there “is no doubt' Battisti “had actual receipt” of them. The property sold for about $116,000, and she is entitled to $108,039 if subsequent appeals are unsuccessful, according to the paper. 'She's going to get that money, but . she's going to lose her house. All the notice requirements were met,' wrote Kwidis.

Joe Askar, Beaver County's chief solicitor, said the judge got the decision right, based on the law. 'The county never wants to see anybody lose their home, but at the same time the tax sale law, the tax real estate law, doesn't give a whole lot of room for error, either,' Askar said. Battisti argued her husband handled the paperwork for the property's taxes before he passed away in 2004. 'It's bad — she had some hard times, I guess her husband kind of took care of a lot of that stuff,' Askar said. 'It seemed that she was having a hard time coping with the loss of her husband — that just made it set in a little more.' Battisti told the paper she has no desire to collect the funds and will do everything in her power to retain possession of her home. Part of that process will include an appeal to the Commonwealth Court, which earlier ordered an evidentiary hearing that led to this ruling. She will be allowed to stay in the home until a final ruling is made.", "reference": "Eileen Battisti insists she paid all taxes in full and was unaware she owed the addition $6.30 .\nThe court ruled that she was given multiple notices about the looming sale and that she even acknowledged receiving them .\nThe home sold for less than half market value at a 2011 auction ."}

The pact allows the presence of American troops in Iraq for three more years. U.S. soldiers gather at the \"Crossed Swords\" in Baghdad's secure Green Zone on Tuesday. The three-member presidency council -- Kurdish President Jalal Talabani, Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi -- approved the agreement unanimously a week after the Iraqi parliament passed the measure. Under the Iraqi constitution, unanimous approval by the presidency council is required for ratification of a law or agreement. The security pact will replace a U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence in Iraq that expires at the end of this year. The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq is December 31, 2011. The agreement -- which stresses respect for Iraqi sovereignty -- \"requests the temporary assistance\" of U.S. forces, but severely restricts their role. The pact says that all military operations are to be carried out with the agreement of Iraq and must be \"fully coordinated\" with Iraqis. A Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee will oversee military operations. Iraq has the \"primary right to exercise jurisdiction\" over U.S. forces \"for grave premeditated felonies,\" the agreement says. Suspects can be held by U.S. forces but must be available to Iraqi authorities for investigation or trial.

Also, the pact says that \"Iraqi land, sea and air shouldn't be used as a launching or transit point for attacks against other countries.\" The presidency council also approved a U.S.-Iraqi bilateral pact called the strategic framework agreement, which covers a wide range of bilateral cooperation efforts and which was approved by the Iraqi parliament last week. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C. Crocker and Gen.

{"id": 15042, "article": "Boston (CNN) -- More than 2,000 women in Boston are homeless, but CNN Hero Roseanna Means is giving them something they can count on -- free, quality medical care. Means is the founder of Women of Means, a nonprofit organization that sends volunteer doctors and nurses into homeless shelters in and around Boston. She recently spoke with CNN's Danielle Berger about the impact of her team's efforts. Below are excerpts from that interview. Danielle Berger: Your program focuses on women. Why women, not men? Roseanna Means: There are so many things that women have to deal with more so than men do -- reproductive years, and then mammograms, then menopause. A lot of women's health is preventive care, and if women lose out on those screening tests, their lives are in danger. In the world of homelessness, there are lots of emotional issues, psychiatric issues, women who have been beaten up so many times they can't connect the dots. They don't have an address. They don't have a phone. They're all sitting in a shelter together, but they're not necessarily friends. There's not a common bond of, \"We're all in this together.\" Everybody is struggling. Everybody's isolated. Everybody's miserable. Berger: How does that affect how they access medical care? Means: Their default position is, \"I'm just going to wait until it's a crisis [and] I have to go to the emergency room.\" And so, what we're able to do by intervening -- in kind of a casual, compassionate, friendly and welcoming way -- is create a relationship so that when it comes time, I can say: \"You know, I think you need to go to the hospital. And one of our people will go there and make sure you get there safely.\" And we'll write a note to make sure that the doctor on the other end knows what's going on. Then they're not costing so much to the system. And everybody benefits. The cost of medical care now is going sky-high because people use emergency rooms inappropriately, or because they're waiting too long to deal with something that could've been dealt with through preventive care and better management. Berger: How does Women of Means grow beyond Roseanna Means? Means: We now have physicians who, five or six years ago, came through as students to learn about our program. And now, they've graduated. They've become doctors. And they remember what it was like to work in these shelters with us. And when we are looking to place a woman with a primary care doctor who understands what these women are living with, we can call up one of these former students and say: \"Remember when you did your rotation at Rosie's Place (a Boston Shelter)? Well, we've got a woman here who really needs to have someone who knows her issues. And we'd like you to take her on.\" And they will. It's great.

Scroll down to see the CCTV and appeal... Last moments: Mariam Alam, of Coventry, West Midlands, was on the brink of death less than 20 minutes after the footage was taken - and police have issued a fresh appeal for information one year after her death . Supermarket entry: The West Midlands Police CCTV footage shows Mariam wearing a red flowery dress, white tights and a pink coat walking with her mother at a Lidl store in the Foleshill area of the city last November . ‘We haven’t forgotten about Mariam,’ Detective Inspector Chris Hanson of Coventry Police said. ‘We’re still very interested in what happened to her. I’m determined to get to the bottom of it.’ The West Midlands Police CCTV footage shows Mariam wearing a red flowery dress, white tights and a pink coat walking with her mother at a Lidl store in the Foleshill area of the city last November. Since her death, detectives have faced a wall of silence from some people while others have given wildly different accounts of how she was hurt, but they are appealing again to the local community. Det Insp Hanson, from the public protection unit, said: ‘Mariam was very poorly when she arrived at hospital and died a short time later. At that stage paramedics didn’t know why she had collapsed. ‘There was no obvious trauma or injuries. At first it was treated as an unexpected death. ‘We were unsure what had caused her to collapse, sometimes children can suddenly and unexpectedly become ill due to an infection or an underlying undiagnosed medical condition.’ Walking out: Since her death, detectives have faced a wall of silence from some people while others have given wildly different accounts of how she was hurt, but they are appealing again to the local community . Leaving: Twelve months later police still have more questions than answers about how the tragic toddler died . But the police probe took a turn when the post mortem exam - carried out as routine when a small child dies unexpectedly - found out that Mariam died as a result of a significant head injury. The impact of the injury was so severe . pathologists likened it to a hard fall from height or a heavy blow to . the head. Police then launched an investigation into Mariam’s death. 'We haven’t forgotten about Mariam. We’re still very interested in what happened to her. I’m determined to get to the bottom of it' Det Insp Chris Hanson, Coventry Police . But 12 months later they have more questions than answers about how the tragic toddler died. When witnesses were interviewed they offered differing accounts of the day she passed away. Early investigations cast doubt on some versions of events and to this day officers cannot even be certain where Mariam suffered the fatal injury. Det Insp Hanson said: ‘Less than 20 minutes after this CCTV image was taken in the nearby Lidl supermarket Mariam was on the brink of death. ‘We have built a picture of what was going on at the time but we’re still not sure where she was, whether she was deliberately hit or whether she had a fall.’ Still looking: Detective Inspector Chris Hanson of Coventry Police's public protection unit said the force 'hasn't forgotten about Mariam' and he is 'determined to get to the bottom' of what happened . Location: Three-year-old Mariam Alam died in hospital in November 2011 after an ambulance was called to a house on this road in the Foleshill area of Coventry . He added that investigators believe people in the community know how she died but are reluctant to come forwards. ‘Very early on in the investigation we had an anonymous call,’ the officer said. ‘That person helped to point us in the right direction. We believe there is someone in the community who is desperate to tell us what happened to Mariam. They may be able to tell us a little bit more. 'We were unsure what had caused her to collapse. Sometimes children can suddenly and unexpectedly become ill due to an infection or an underlying undiagnosed medical condition' Det Insp Chris Hanson, Coventry Police . ‘We would appeal for that person to get back in touch.’ Police will today recreate Mariam’s last journey - made on November 30 last year at around 1pm. They will visit the mosque near her home on Fisher Road in Foleshill and leaflet the area in an effort to jog people’s memories.

They were laid to rest by hordes of mourners in Suruc, Turkey, their ages emblazoned in red paint on rickety tombstones. Members of the YPG, the People's Protection Unit, they had been fighting tirelessly against the extremist group as it struggles to take hold of the border town. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of mourners carried the coffins of three Kurdish fighters into a makeshift cemetery today in the border town of Kobane as the conflict against ISIS continues . Their corpses now lie alongside 27 others who have perished in the conflict this month. ISIS holds part of the town but has been forced to retreat following persistent clashes with Kurdish forces in recent weeks. Their efforts have also been thwarted by sustained airstrikes by American and Arab forces. Today mourners wept as men carried wooden coffins through sandy streets and lowered them into shallow graves. The Kurdish flag was draped over each of their coffins, with mourners gesturing for peace as they carried them into the site. Earlier this week a young woman and two men were buried in the same cemetery after perishing in the battle for Kobane which began almost a month ago. Since the outbreak of war in Syria, more than 1million refugees are thought to have crossed the border into Turkey seeking safety. Praying for peace: The mourners followed the coffins into the cemetery where another 27 lie, their caskets draped in the Kurdish flag . The four fighters are the latest to have been slaughtered as clashes between Kurdish forces and the extremist group continue in Kobane .

With so many civilians displaced, it is almost impossible to locate the family of each fighter who has died in the ongoing conflicts. Strangers carried the coffin of one woman to her grave in Suruc this week after being unable to contact her loved ones. Though they did not know the deceased, they wept for her sacrifice as they lowered her body into the ground. Only five of the thirty graves dug in the cemetery belong to fighters whose families have been found, it was reported. Tensions on the border town have flared in recent weeks with a series of American and Arab airstrikes obliterating the black ISIS flag once positioned on top of a hillside earlier this week. The strikes have devastated parts of the region with hundreds of homes destroyed. But, as a yellow Kurdish flag was raised on the same hillside today, signs the terror group has finally been thwarted were rife. A video released earlier this month depicted black-clad ISIS fighters patrolling the streets, allegedly keeping Yazidi virgins and young Syrian women locked in brothels for their pleasing. Small cells are thought to still be operating within the city, though joint attacks from Kurdish fighters and American and Arab air forces have undoubtedly weakened their position.

Kaytlin Shelton, 17, who is eight months pregnant, took a photo of the $3 meal at a Chickasha school  and showed it to her father who said it was not satisfactory. Her father Vince Holton said: 'I can go pay a dollar for a lunchabe and get more food in it. Schools are responsible for children while they're at school.'

A Labour-run council has been accused of ‘petty politics’ after launching a last-minute bid to block a private school’s pioneering plan to become an academy. Kings School, which charges £10,000 a year, wants to merge with a nearby state primary when it changes its status at the end of this term. But the historic move is in doubt after North Tyneside Council decided to seek a judicial review, nine months after it learned of the scheme. It claims a statutory consultation process was not conducted properly. Row: King's School in Tynemouth wanted to merge with other local schools but the Labour-run council has opposed it . David Bilton, the chairman of the trust that would run the new school, yesterday branded the legal challenge a ‘cynical move designed to cause the maximum anxiety’. He added: ‘To put petty politics ahead of peoples’ wishes and children’s future education is thoroughly reprehensible. ‘At a time when the local authority is seeking to justify cuts in services, it is surprising that they regard the inevitable expense of seeking a judicial review in these circumstances as a proper use of council tax.’ Tory councillors complained the move was ‘ideologically’ driven to deny ordinary people access to an elite school. Group leader Judith Wallace said: ‘The Labour party is ideologically opposed to independent schools - although hypocritically, both locally and nationally, a number of Labour politicians do choose to send their own children to them’. Other fee-paying schools have previously applied to become academies. Many have seen pupil numbers fall as a result of the recession. But Kings School, in the seaside village of Tynemouth, is understood to be the first to include a local state primary in the process. The mixed school for four to 19-year-olds, which was founded in 1860 and whose former pupils include Stan Laurel and England and Leicester Tigers rugby player Toby Flood, has lost around a third of its pupils in recent years. Kings School takes pupils from four to 18 years old and its motto is Moribus Civilis - ‘behave properly’. Old boys:  Film star Stan Laurel and England Rugby ace Toby Flood both attended the King's School which wants to become part of an academy . Senior figures at Woodards Schools, a registered charity which runs a group of Anglican schools including Kings, decided to apply to become an academy. This allows it to continue to be run independently while being backed by taxpayers’ money instead of fees. The plans included merging with nearby Priory Primary School, which was rated outstanding in its last Ofsted inspection. The new school, called Kings Priory Academy, would continue to run on both sites but would be operated by the Woodard Academies Trust. A total of 1,425 places would be available with maximum class sizes of 25. Details were announced in September last year and the school is already heavily oversubscribed. But the plans are in jeopardy after North Tyneside Council, which has had to make savings of £40 million over the past four years, claimed the consultation had not included ‘appropriate’ people with an interest. Parents with children already in the schools were consulted and 90 per cent were in favour of the change. But the council says parents with children at other schools in the area should have been asked for their opinions. Elected Labour mayor Norma Redfearn said: ‘The council has a responsibility to ensure that all children and young people in North Tyneside can access the highest quality education. ‘The impact of the proposed Kings Priory Academy on the wider schools system in North Tyneside has not been properly considered.’ Mr Bilton insisted the legal threat would not derail the merger and said it would be up and running by the start of the autumn term.", "reference": "King's School in Tynemouth wants to be an academy with local schools .\nFilm star Stan Laurel and England rugby ace Toby Flood attended the private school .\nLabour-run Tyneside Council is opposing the plan sparking fury ."}
{"id": 15048, "article": "(CNN) -- The competition for payment processing services, especially mobile payments, is heating up. Last week Google kicked it up a notch by announcing that it's phasing out Google Checkout in favor of the new Google Wallet. This service supports in-store tap-to-pay payments from your phone via near field communications technology, as well as purchases on the web. If you log in to your Google Checkout account now, you'll be notified that you've been switched over to Google Wallet. Any credit cards or other payment information you've saved in Google Checkout will be available in Google Wallet. The catch: Google Wallet isn't yet widely used for in-store purchases. So far its NFC payments are enabled only for Sprint Nexus S users who also have a Citibank MasterCard or a Google prepaid card, and who are making purchases at MasterCard PayPass-enabled merchant locations. So this holiday shopping season, it's unlikely that many people will be waving their phones around to buy holiday gifts. But in the coming year, more U.S. smartphones will be equipped with NFC, bringing a variety of tap-to-pay or wave-to-pay options to consumers. A competing NFC-based mobile phone payment system, ISIS, is launching in some markets (Austin, Texas, and Salt Lake City) in 2012. Why are U.S. retailers slow to adopt NFC payment technology? One reason is the expense and effort required to install NFC-enabled point-of-sale equipment in stores and to integrate it with merchants' systems. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg dynamic: Retailers typically don't invest in offering a new payment option until they see widespread consumer demand; but few consumers are likely to prefer a payment option that's not yet widely accepted. At the recent Open Mobile Summit, Google VP of Payments Osama Bedier observed: \"Merchants adopt new payment models because they increase sales. If I gave you a payment option that was totally free, merchants wouldn't adopt it unless it increased sales.\" GigaOm writer Ryan Kim contends that payments alone aren't enough to make NFC popular. \"Mobile marketing, along with consumer loyalty, will be in the front seat as well and will be critical in helping to drive the growth and adoption of NFC,\" he wrote. \"While the idea of contactless payments is intriguing, there is increasingly an awareness that tapping a phone to pay for an item will not sell itself. ... Discounts, daily deals and loyalty reward programs can be activated through NFC technologies.\" At the Open Mobile Summit, Dickson Chu, managing director of digital networks for Citi's Global Enterprise Payments unit, said he also thinks retailers' adoption of NFC will be driven by marketing. But he cautioned: \"Reward discounts are a race to the bottom. Not every merchant engages in that, it's just not part of their economics.\" Chu thinks that in the long run, merchants may use NFC not just to deliver deals and coupons, but to deepen relationships with individual consumers. \"That's interesting, and it may be more profitable, but it's a longer term play,\" he noted. Another Open Mobile Summit panelist, PayPal's VP for mobile, David Marcus, made this point: \"Today, retailers learn about customers at the least effective time -- just when they're leaving the store. They'd like to know about you when you arrive at the store, so they can customize your shopping experience and treat you properly.\" That may sound creepy to consumers (remember \"Minority Report\"?), but in the competitive retail business, merchants are constantly seeking an edge to boost sales and repeat business. The technology of NFC itself is still a moving target, and standards aren't settled. Merchants are wary of investing in the next Betamax. This week a global organization of wireless carriers with GSM mobile networks announced that 45 carriers around the world -- including AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless in the U.S. -- are supporting standards for NFC payments and committed to support and launch services based on it. But, as PaidContent noted, \"The crucial questions now will be whether these carriers stick to their word; and whether handset makers, other infrastructure providers and consumers follow these carriers' lead.\" In the meantime, while these issues sort out, Google also announced this week that it's making it easier to integrate Google Wallet into mobile web payments. Granted, at most stores this probably would not make sense yet -- but it might appeal to the many consumers who buy movie tickets online, rather than stand in line at the box office. So Google is partnering with Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com to offer Google Wallet as a payment option for their mobile web checkout. Once this option is implemented, users won't have to try to type their 16-digit credit card number plus the expiration date and security code on their phone in order to buy a movie ticket. Typing on mobile phones is a notorious hassle, and mobile Web users often abandon their online shopping carts when they reach the point of entering payment information. Of course, Fandango.com and Movietickets.com don't just sell tickets on the Web. They also offer their own apps for iPhone, Android, and other smartphone platforms. It's unclear whether Google Wallet will be offered as a payment option for in-app purchases -- but Albert Wenger, a partner with Union Square Ventures, observed that if Google decided to offer this ability, it might \"pull the rug out from underneath Apple's 30% tax on in-app purchases.\" The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Amy Gahran.", "reference": "Google Wallet supports tap-to-pay phone payments using near field communication .\nU.S. retailers are slow to adapt to NFC tools because of installation expenses and efforts .\nGoogle Wallet will be offered as an option for Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com .\n45 carriers around the world have announced their support of standards for NFC payments ."}

On Tuesday the NSW government announced their support for the trial, and this will bring the legal use of cannabis and other forms of the drug for sufferers of chronic illness one step closer. Premier Mike Baird also declared his personal approval in parliament on Tuesday, and said he was moved by the story of 24-year-old Daniel Haslam, who has suffered with an agressive form of bowel cancer for the past four years. 'Why not take a stance to say to the rest of the country, this matters. It's time we did something about it,' Mr Baird told parliament, the ABC report. 'So I say at the same time, we want to give the terminally ill and those around them, their carers, their family, greater peace of mind. 'We also want to ensure that carers aren't forced to watch their loved ones suffer when their pain can be alleviated,' he continued. A working group has already been established, and will look at issues surrounding supply, distribution, before delivering a report at the end of this year. The government are also making the move to amend police guidelines so anyone found in possession of a small amount of marijuana who is on a register of terminally ill patients will not be charged. Labor has offered bipartisan support on the issue, and opposition leader John Robertson told the Sydney Morning Herald terminally ill people who wanted to use the drug for medicinal purposes: 'Should not suffer the further humiliation of being dragged through our courts and treated as criminals.' Scroll down for video . Mr Baird said he was moved by the plight of 24-year-old Daniel Haslam (left) whose mother Lucy (right) has been campaigning for the legalisation of the drug for those with chronic illness . Earlier this year before she addressed parliament about the issue Daily Mail Australia spoke to Lucy Haslam, Daniel's mother, about the relief that marijuana has brought to her son's life. Mrs Haslam, a retired nurse, and her husband Lou, a former police officer, have watched their son Daniel deteriorate from a fit and high achieving student to a frail and depressed young man. In a speech that Mrs Haslam delivered to Parliament House in Canberra in June, she detailed how her youngest son desperately clings to the hope and relief that illegal cannabis offers him. While Daniel continues his four year fight with cancer, the effects of chemotherapy have been detrimental. NSW Labor has provided bipartisan support for the trial and the the move to amend police guidlines so anyone found in possession of the drug who is on a register of terminally ill patients will not be charged . Cannabis provides solace for Daniel, unlike others such as antiemetic drugs which are supposed to relieve him from nausea and vomiting induced by cancer treatment. Mrs Haslam told ABC on Tuesday she was beside herself when she was notified of Mr Baird's decision. 'I think I gave him a big hug and a kiss. He's a very kind, caring man, you know he's a dad,' she said. 'I think he probably knows as any parent the horrible feeling of watching your child suffer and feeling powerless. He can empathise with that I think,' Mrs Haslam added. Mr Haslam has been suffering from bowel cancer for four years and has severe side effects from chemotherapy which cannabis helps to alleviate . Just last month the Victorian opposition leader Daniel Andrews said cannabis should be available for people who needed treatment in exceptional circumstances. Labor wants to legalise cannabis oil for the treatment of conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and Parkinson's Disease. He said the same rules would not apply for recreational use. 'In some cases, parents are forced to choose between breaking the law and watching their child suffer,\" Mr Andrews said. 'Children are in pain, families are suffering, people are living in fear, and outdated laws are getting in the way.' The move follows public campaigns by Victorian families who have successfully treated their chronically ill children when other medicines have not worked.

{"id": 15052, "article": "Jon Whiteford had a secret so macabre, that when a Kentucky sheriff's deputy showed up to question him about it, he pulled out a handgun and killed himself. About three years ago, he deep-froze the body of his mother, Faye Whiteford, law officers said. They don't think he killed her. She appears to have died of natural causes at the age of 96 in spring of 2011, Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Thursday. Since Jon Whiteford is dead, there are no charges against him. But law officers want to know what he can no longer tell them so they can complete the puzzle of what happened to Faye Whiteford's body from the time of her death until they found her remains this April -- tied up in tarp in the yard of a ramshackle home. The picture they have painted so far based on conversations with witnesses and acquaintances has the makings of the stuff of a grotesque novel. Behind the 8-ball . As Faye Whiteford lay bedridden in their home in Science Hill for the last years of her life, her son sunk into a financial morass. He took care of her but was also dependent upon her Social Security and retirement benefits. When she died, he didn't want to lose that income, the sheriff's office said. So he concealed her death and postponed her funeral. He purchased a freezer where he kept her remains, the sheriff said. Talking with him about her was a tough topic. \"We didn't know she had passed away, and we were afraid to ask,\" Al Fried, one of Jon's close friends, told CNN affiliate WLEX. But it seems the two friends did speak about the financial implications of her death. \"I guess he was afraid to report that his mom died because of what I said about the funds disappearing,\" Fried said. His mother's retirement checks were not enough to save Jon Whiteford from getting behind the eight ball. The family home went into foreclosure. \"He was forced to move out of his home somewhere around Christmas of 2013,\" the sheriff's office said. Whiteford found a house to rent in another county, but was in disrepair, not fit to live in without some work. Law officers believe he took his mother's body there. And as the winter was a bitter, it would remain frozen if left outdoors. In the meantime, Whiteford moved next door to his mother's former home, into the house owned by a friend who did not live in it. Inquisitive law officers . Eventually, authorities wondered why there were no signs of life from his mother, and a fraud investigation into the Social Security benefits began. On March 29 this year, a deputy decided to go question Jon Whiteford. Some three weeks after his suicide, police brought in dogs trained to sniff out human remains, but they caught no scent of Faye Whiteford's body. During the investigation, detectives came across the property Jon Whiteford had rented and decided to check it out. There, a detective found a body tied up in tarp lying partially under a wooden box at the edge of the driveway. It was Faye Whiteford's. The sheriff's office is looking for witnesses to answer many of the questions about what happened to her that her son would not.", "reference": "When a sheriff's deputy arrived to question Jon Whiteford, he killed himself .\nHis mother appears to have died of natural causes in spring of 2011 .\nHer remains were tied up in the yard of a ramshackle home .\nAuthorities: When she died, he didn't want to lose that income ."}

Hungry: The British Red Cross is to distribute food to poorer families for the first time since the Second World War in a bid to tackle food poverty . The British Red Cross is to start distributing food to hard-up families for the first time since the Second World War as it warned that thousands face cuts to their household budgets. Volunteers from the charity will go into supermarkets from next month to ask shoppers to donate tinned and dry food to be passed on to families facing food poverty. The charity blamed a combination of the recession, welfare cuts and the increased cost of living for more UK families struggling to put food on the table. It described its campaign as a 'toe in the water' as it considers further steps to tackle the growing problem of food poverty. Once food is collected from shoppers, it will be passed on to the most needy through the FareShare charity. Juliet Mountford, the charity's head of UK service development, said the Red Cross agreed to assist FareShare on the basis of 'strong evidence of an increased need for support on food poverty issues'. Nearly 500,000 people in the UK needed support from food banks last year, according to figures from the Trussel Trust. Last month a report shed light on the chronic throw-away culture affecting the food industry, where up to two-fifths of a crop of fruit or vegetables can be wasted because it is 'ugly'. Produce grown in the UK that does not meet retailer standards on size or shape or is blemished is often used for animal feed or simply ploughed back into the ground even though it is edible, with as much as 40 per cent of a crop rejected. The report, commissioned by the UK's global food security programme, also showed that the average household throws away more than 5kg (11lb) of food per week, and nearly two-thirds of that is avoidable. The waste costs £480 a year per household on average, and £680 per family. Households throw away a fifth of the food they buy, wasting it for reasons ranging from cooking and preparing too much to not using it before it goes off, the study showed. Campaign: Red Cross volunteers will be asking people shopping in supermarkets to donate some food to the campaign . Consumption and initial production are the areas where the majority of food is wasted in the UK, the study said. According to a Red Cross report released today the number of people relying on food aid has increased by 75 per cent across Europe over the last three years with an estimated 43 million struggling for enough food to eat. A further 120million are at risk of poverty, according to the Independent.

Alex Hunter, the California teen who needed to raise $11,000 for dentures after he lost his teeth beating two different types of cancer has said a huge 'Thank you' to the public after they donated the money in less than one day. According to his mother, Lisbeth, the brave 16-year-old has been 'blown away' by the reaction from around the world as cash poured in from those touched by his story after reading it on Tuesday on MailOnline. Declined treatment by his insurance company, Alex took to his gofundme page to express his heartfelt gratitude, 'from friends, to family, to my community and everyone else that has been beyond generous to help me in meeting and surpassing my goal. Thank you!' Mom, . Lisbeth, told MailOnline that if everything goes according to plan Alex . could be fitted with his new teeth in two weeks, just in time for the . start of the new school year. Lisbeth . said that the first thing Alex will do when he gets his new dentures . 'will be to celebrate with a smile and also a good meal', now that he . will be able to eat anything he wants. In . less than 48 hours, Alex has seen donations of more than $17,000 flood . in to his gofundme page to help him and his initial goal of $11,000 was reached in less than . 20 hours. An . ecstatic Lisbeth told MailOnline that when Alex was told he would be . getting his dentures much sooner than he may have thought, he beamed 'a . toothless smile'. 'It's a bit overwhelming,' said Lisbeth. 'It's amazing. Never in our wildest dreams did we think that this would happen. Fighter: Alex Hunter, 16, has had all of his teeth removed after battling cancer twice -and his insurance company declined to cover his dentures because it is not a medical issue . 'We appreciated any help and never expected anything like this. 'There is always the cliche that words are not enough, but in this case that is true. 'Thank you for your generosity, thank you.' One anonymous donor pledged $5,000 and Lisbeth said that she was extremely touched by the gesture. 'I am praying God blesses you as much as you have blessed Alex,' said Lisbeth to MailOnline. At the very lastest Alex will have his dentures fitted two weeks into the new school year and Lisbeth said that the remaining money left over will remain in an account to help Alex with any more medical expenses he will need. Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth removed two weeks ago after years of radiation left them fragile and impossible to use. Goal reached: Alex Hunter's gofundme page has managed to raise in excess of the $11,000 he needs to have dentures fitted after his insurance company declined to pay for them . While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it would not cover the dentures, his family said - prompting their internet fund raising. 'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier on Tuesday about the insurance company's stance. 'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.' Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a counselor, will be able to go ahead and get his dentures fitted. On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time . Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, on Monday in the hope of raising the money. By Tuesday afternoon, when the MailOnline first published Alex's story, the fund stood at $1,000, but in a little less than six hours had smashed through its target. Inspiration: Despite his health struggles, Alex is a top student who dreams of becoming a counselor . 'He doesn't smile because his teeth were never attractive,' his grandmother said earlier about the brave teen. 'He was anxious to get them out and get it over with but now we're waiting to see what's next.' Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek. He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face. He was also left with a thin frame, teeth problems and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free. Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer. On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer. But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family say he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he is again cancer-free. Hopeful: His mother Liz, pictured right, launched a gofundme help and is appealing to foundations for funds . In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend. Relatives told KERO that he once put together a yearbook for a friend, including photos and signatures from staff and students, after the teen could not afford to buy one from the school. Alex is also taking advanced placement classes and has been singing with the choir for two years. He is already thinking about college, where he wants to major in psychology and sociology. 'He's just so positive,' his grandmother said. 'He sings, he's really active in school - but kids do stare at him.

{"id": 15060, "article": "Meriam Yehya Ibrahim faces a death sentence in Sudan for apostasy after a court ruled she converted from Islam. Now the 27-year-old Christian woman, a wife and mother expecting another child, embarks on a long and unpredictable legal journey. A variety of factors -- Sudan's legal system, differences between its constitution and Sharia law imposed by the sentencing judge, her pregnancy -- ensure there will no execution any time soon. Ibrahim's lawyer argues the sentence should not stand, and an international outcry could pressure Sudan's government to intervene. Even if the sentence stands, Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth. Here are some questions and answers on what happens now: . What is this all about? On Thursday, a Khartoum court convicted Ibrahim of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, and sentenced her to death. Ibrahim was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6, and she was raised by her mother as a Christian. Her lawyer, Mohamed Jar Elnabi, said the case started after Ibrahim's brother filed a complaint against her. The brother alleged Ibrahim had gone missing for several years and that her family was shocked to find she had married a Christian man. Because her father was Muslim, the Sharia law court considered her to be the same. It refused to recognize her marriage to a Christian and also convicted her of adultery, with an additional sentence of 100 lashes. Before imposing the sentence, the court gave her an opportunity to recant her Christian faith, but Elnabi said Ibrahim refused to do so, declaring: \"I am a Christian, and I will remain a Christian.\" Attempts by CNN to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister about the case were unsuccessful. Can she appeal? Elnabi told CNN on Friday that he plans to ask an appeals court to review the sentence, and could file the request as soon as Sunday. That will begin a legal process in which the case works its way through Sudan's Supreme Court and up to the Constitutional Court, the nation's highest, he said. There was no definite timetable for the appeal process, according to Elnabi, who said any death sentence must be ratified by both the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court. What is the basis of the appeal? Elnabi argues that Sudan's constitution allows religious conversion without restriction. \"I am very much optimistic that the appeal court will reverse the death sentence issued by the primary court,\" he said. Katherine Perks of the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies agreed. She said the verdict goes against Sudan's \"own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law.\" However, Sudan has a history of religious discrimination. Under President Omar al-Bashir, the African nation \"continues to engage in systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief,\" the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its 2014 report. The country imposes Sharia law on Muslims and non-Muslims alike and punishes acts of \"indecency\" and \"immorality\" by floggings and amputations, the commission said. \"Conversion from Islam is a crime punishable by death, suspected converts to Christianity face societal pressures, and government security personnel intimidate and sometimes torture those suspected of conversion,\" said the commission appointed by the U.S. Congress and president. Since 1999, the State Department has called Sudan one of the worst offenders of religious rights. Do her pregnancy and family situation make a difference? Ibrahim is eight months pregnant and has a 20-month-old son who stays with her in prison. Elnabi said her husband, Daniel Wani, uses a wheelchair and \"totally depends on her for all details of his life.\" As practiced in Sudan, Sharia law prohibits the execution of pregnant women. Instead, the sentence is delayed until two years after lactation. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before carrying out the sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. According to Elnabi, Ibrahim is having a difficult pregnancy, but a request to send her to a private hospital was denied \"due to security measures.\" Will international pressure make any difference? Human rights groups and Western governments are complaining about Ibrahim's case. \"We call upon the government of Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, including one's right to change one's faith or beliefs, a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in Sudan's own 2005 Interim Constitution,\" said a statement by the embassies of the United States, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Amnesty International described Ibrahim as a prisoner of conscience. \"Adultery and apostasy are acts which should not be considered crimes at all, let alone meet the international standard of 'most serious crimes' in relation to the death penalty,\" said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. \"It is a flagrant breach of international human rights law.\" The case comes as the world focuses on more than 200 schoolgirls abducted by Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria who threaten to sell them into slavery. Whether Ibrahim's case will generate the same strong reaction as the Nigerian situation remains unclear. In the past, a forceful international outcry has influenced similar apostasy cases. In 2006, an Afghan man threatened with the death penalty for converting to Christianity was released into exile after Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai reportedly intervened at the behest of his Western backers, over the objections of the country's conservative judiciary.", "reference": "Pregnant Christian woman sentenced to death for apostasy in Sudan .\nMeriam Ibrahim's sentence now must get higher court endorsement .\nSharia law in Sudan delays executing pregnant women until two years after they give birth .\nRights groups, Western governments protest the case ."}

Ms Scoggins, who runs her site with a team of volunteers, is well-placed to offer guidance in costume design. She trained as a historian before turning to theater where she worked as both an actor and in costume design. She says the idea for the site was born because her friends couldn’t find anything appropriate to wear for trick or treating in with their . kids. 'Even college girls feel under pressure to be sexy,' she said. 'They didn’t . feel free to wear regular costumes and step outside that very narrow . uniform. I don’t have a problem with sexy, I just want a full range of . options.' Take Back Halloween offers DIY guides and stockist links for ensembles based on inspiring women that readers can create at home, avoiding suggestions that require a needle and thread.

Alongside each post is a brief history lesson on the character so that the wearer is well-informed when a fellow party-goer asks, 'Who are you?' - but they are so informative that she says some educators turn to the site in history lesson plans. Ms Scoggins says that the site needs funding to meed demand from its millions of users, and there is currently a campaign running on Kickstarter to raise money for much-needed technological upgrades.", "reference": "The Take Back Halloween website offers DIY guides for costumes inspired by legendary women, such as Amelia Earhart, Frida Kahlo and Medusa ."}

The five friends who play in the Wee Bag Band, a group more well known as an unsigned pub band, will be flown more than 15,000 miles by the Air Force to bases in Cuba, Greenland, Bahamas and Honduras. Their next stop of the ten day tour will be Cuba, where are flying via military plane from Baltimore to perform for the troops celebrating St. Patrick's day for an undisclosed amount. Scroll down for video . The Wee Bag Band from Denbighshire, Wales who have been handed a gig of a lifetime after being booked by the Pentagon to tour far-flung US Air Force bases . Members of the band were stunned when they got an e-mail from U.S. military chiefs asking them to perform for the troops. Before they agreed, they had to call up the Pentagon to check that they weren't part of an elaborate prank or a con. All five members of the band, which includes Paul Bassom, Rory McGough, Steve Own, Julian Anderson and Alan Colinson,  have regular day jobs, ranging from motor engineering to computer work. For years they have been playing Irish music at weddings, pubs and festivals, but now they're taking a tour from Central America to the Antarctic Circle. Video courtesy of Peter Simmonds . The band is ordinarily a pub band, and has played at events like weddings and festivals for around five years . Luck o' the Irish: Their brand of music is primarily Irish jig music, which they intend to use to get the members of the U.S. force dancing . Lead singer and IT consultant Rory McGough said: 'The first thing I got was an email from the Pentagon asking if could we come and play some music. 'I thought it was like one of those scams about putting money into a bank account from Nigeria so I was going to put it into the spam folder. 'But I thought I had better check, and low and behold the next thing I am being asked if we could manage to do a week-long world tour! The trip: Their ten day tour will take them around the world, from sunny Cuba to freezing Greenland . Flying: Beginning by flying from Manchester to Baltimore, then on to the world's destinations . 'We seem to have a lot of friends now who play tambourine and would like to tag along.' The pub band from the tiny rural town of Denbigh, in North Wales, will cover thousands of miles between military bases to play Irish music for the troops. Their tour will see them fly from Manchester to Baltimore, Baltimore to Greenland, then back to Baltimore before flying to Cuba via Florida. Live: The Welsh band also take their brand of Irish folk music to festivals and other events . The band has been advertising their tour in the U.S. Air Forces they are playing for to celebrate St. Patrick's Day . After playing for the troops in Cuba they fly on to the Bahamas before going back to Florida to fly to Honduras and then to Miami before flying home. They will be starting off in the remote icy wilderness of Thule in northern Greenland - making them the most northerly gigging band in the world. McGough said: 'The US Military have told us that when we play at Thule in Greenland we will set the record for the most northerly gig ever played by a British band. Their music has seen them play in front of crowds of hundreds in large venues, to smaller pubs with only dozens in the audience . Not spam: The band had to check that they weren't being scammed before they took the opportunity, with one member saying 'I was going to put it into the spam folder' 'Also this is the first time the USAF have asked a non-USA band to perform at their bases. 'By all accounts they're really looking forward to it because they've never had anything like it before. 'And of course the Americans have a huge Irish contingency and sometimes celebrate St Patrick's day more than the Irish do.' After braving Greenland with temperatures of -13F they will be flown by the U.S. Air Force into the 86F heats of Cuba. Support worker Paul Bassom, who plays guitar and sings in the band, said he was keen to promote dancing among the troops. The band think that they were selected because some of the U.S. bases have a huge Irish contingency and celebrate St Patrick's day more than the Irish do .

{"id": 15065, "article": "(CNN) -- A federal judge who came under criticism for forwarding a racist e-mail aimed at President Barack Obama earlier this spring will be taking partial retirement, according to a U.S. court website. Montana Chief U.S. District Court Judge Richard Cebull had apologized and offered regrets for the incident, telling the Billings Gazette at the time it was \"a hard lesson to learn.\" Cebull will take \"senior status,\" next March, according the judiciary's main administrative office, meaning he will vacate his seat but will be available to hear a reduced caseload. Obama will name the judge's replacement. Civil rights groups had demanded Cebull's immediate resignation after the e-mail was revealed seven months ago. He is currently the subject of an internal misconduct review by a panel of fellow judges, the Judicial Council of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. That review has not been completed. Judge asks for probe after sending racist Obama e-mail . Cebull did not write the offensive material, but admitted forwarding the message on February 20 to a few friends after it was sent to him by his brother. The Great Falls Tribune was given a copy and reported that the message said: . \"Normally I don't send or forward a lot of these, but even by my standards, it was a bit touching. I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine. \"A little boy said to his mother, 'Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white?' His mother replied, 'Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!'\" Obama is of mixed race. \"To say it's inappropriate and stupid is an extreme understatement,\" Cebull said according to the Billings newspaper. \"There is no doubt it's racist. It wasn't forwarded for that purpose. If anything, it was political.\" The Billings-based judge was named to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2001. He has been chief judge since 2008, overseeing two other full-time district judges, three senior or part-time judges and five magistrates. His chambers did not return a call from CNN for comment. Cebull said in the interview his conduct in court over many years has shown he is not a racist, but he admitted the public got that impression from the e-mail. \"And I don't blame them,\" he added. The judge also separately told the Great Falls Tribune, \"The only reason I can explain it to you is I am not a fan of our president, but this goes beyond not being a fan. I didn't send it as racist, although that's what it is. I sent it out because it's anti-Obama.\" Judge apologizes for forwarding a racist e-mail aimed at Obama . Some advocacy organizations said the 68-year-old Cebull should have fully retired, and should have done so months ago. \"Americans expect the courts to be fair, impartial, and open to all,\" said Michael Keegan of the liberal People for the American Way. \"Cebull clearly demonstrated that he does not have the temperament to serve as a federal judge, period.\" Standards warranting removal are not clear, beyond a violation of civil or criminal law. Congress would have to initiate impeachment proceedings, but the few judges to face that have usually resigned before those proceedings went far. There is no indication the judge in Montana would be subjected to either option. Senior status is a common option for federal judges who have earned enough seniority to qualify for a full government salary while working only part time. A judge must be at least 65 and have served for 15 years. Courts with especially crowded dockets rely heavily on senior judges to help pick up the caseload. According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, senior judges essentially provide volunteer service to the courts, and typically handle about 15% of the federal courts' workload annually. Retired Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, and John Paul Stevens are all on senior status. But unlike their lower court counterparts, retired justices cannot sit on any Supreme Court cases.

{"id": 15070, "article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's time this debate was settled once and for all. Football or soccer? What do you think the round-ball game should be called? While it may be a basic discussion; arguing whether the beautiful game should be called \"football\" or \"soccer\" is one of the most fundamental debates of the code. On the face it, the answer should be simple. The world body -- FIFA -- has the word \"football\" in its title. End of story? Not quite. The term soccer was coined as slang for \"association,\" in England in the 1880s. The Oxford University Association Football Club's Web site explains that former England captain Charles Wreford-Brown is commonly credited with its origin. Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football (\"rugger\") and \"association\" football. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, the word soccer is a British term, not an American one. Soccer is more commonly used in countries that play other forms of football, i.e. Americans also play gridiron football and Australians who play \"Aussie Rules\" football -- a completely different sport entirely. Soccer was initially referred to as football in the United States. In 1913 the United States of America Football Association was formed. In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation. Meanwhile they now have the Football Federation of Australia, it's hard to imagine a change to the national side's \"Socceroos\" nickname anytime soon. The \"Footyroos\" doesn't quite have the same sound to it. Now, you may be sitting back in Britain reading this and wondering why there should be any debate at all about the name of football? If you are thinking that, just remember one of the most popular shows in Britain is called \"Soccer Saturday\", so it's not as clear cut as you may think! Even the sport's governing body seems to be open to both options. At next year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the area where fans will gather during the tournament is to be called \"Soccer City\". Maybe the word \"football\" just doesn't work? We'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why. Let us know in the SoundOff box below.

Ed Miliband should condemn the strike immediately — no ifs and no buts,' he told the Evening Standard. The London Chamber of Commerce suggests the action will cost £50million-a-day, or £200million across the four days of strikes.

He said: 'I can't possibly sit . down and talk to Bob Crow when he is not negotiating with our team, . with the London Underground staff and they are threatening a totally . pointless and, definitely will be, debilitating strike.' Appearing . on LBC 97.3, he said: 'There are no compulsory redundancies here. Nobody is being forced out and actually we have so far had more than . 1,000 expressions of interest in voluntary redundancies, so we are . already there.' But minutes later Mr Crow appeared as a called on the mayor's phone-in to claim he would 'love' to call off the strike. 'We are not here to score points - all we want is an opportunity to negotiate about the Tube,' Mr Crow said. 'We are asking you to listen to our point of view. We would love to call the strike off.' Mr Crow accused the mayor of refusing to suspend the ticket office closures. But Mr Johnson replied: 'That is complete nonsense. We are more than happy to engage on these issues. Of course there are job losses involved but there are no compulsory redundancies. 'We have already had more than 1,000 people showing an interest in voluntary redundancy. 'Call off this pointless strike which will do nothing other than cost your members their wages.' Mr Crow said later it was clear the mayor was still refusing to meet unions. Labour's shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Nobody wants strikes and both sides should now get back around the negotiating table and sort this out as a matter of urgency. 'It is disappointing that the mayor and Transport for London have not reached a resolution with the unions ahead of this strike.' The chief executive of a central London casino attacked the strike, saying it would hit an industry exhibition being attended by representatives from around the world. Simon Thomas, chief executive of Hippodrome Casino in Leicester Square, said it was 'frankly embarrassing' that the exhibition at the ExCeL Centre would be disrupted by the industrial action. 'Gaming industry executives from across the world are in London this week and it is outrageous that this strike is being held. 'Just when the economy is recovering we have this prehistoric attitude, which is not welcome.' Mr Crow and Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) general secretary Manuel Cortes have accused Boris Johnson of refusing to meet them to discuss the closure of ticket offices, and the pair went to City Hall to try to confront him. The Mayor's official spokesman said: 'Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are now grandstanding. If they were really serious about meeting the mayor they wouldn't have called a strike in the middle of a consultation, a strike that 70 per cent of members haven't voted for. 'Instead they could have engaged constructively with TfL before we ever reached Acas, where only yesterday they refused a fresh offer of dialogue which would involve extending the consultation period.

Pony patches: A new class of pilots is choosing to wear a patch in reference to the kids show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic' A new group of Air Force pilots are comfortable enough in their masculinity to wear a 'My Little Pony' patch on their uniforms. The patch was chosen by the 24 student pilots of class 14-05 at Vance Air Force Base - one of four centers in the U.S. where commissioned officers are trained to become professional pilots. Their patch is an allusion to the sub-culture of 'bronies', male fans of the children's show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'. The current show is a reboot of the 1980s cartoon and line of plastic pony toys. The new show has surprisingly spurned a sub-culture of male fans, and an increasing amount of these 'bronies' are members of the military. But . according to Vance Air Force Base spokesman 1st Lieuntenant Thomas . Barger, this class's patch was a joke and not reflective of their . appreciation for the show. 'It was kind of a fluke,' Lt Barger told Air Force Times. Lt . Barger explained that a student proposed the 'My Little Pilot: Flying . is Magic' design as a joke during the slideshow presentation of patch . options. 'That patch . made it all the way through the approval process and is even more ironic . since the class never really wanted it in the first place, ' Lt Barger . said. 'They thought it was so off the wall that it was hilarious. They . have embraced the irony and the humor of the patch an in so doing have . fostered closer ties with each other.' But . the patch is far from unusual. Class patches usually contain some . reference to current pop culture, like the game angry birds or the movie . Austin Powers. Past patches: Class patches are usually humorous and contain some reference to current pop culture. For example: a Pabst Blue Ribbon patch, left, and an Angry Birds patch, right . And that's exactly the point. 'We . train world-class pilots who will go on to defend out great nation. Fostering camaraderie, morale and unity on a regular basis and through . small means - like a tastefully humorous patch - enhances our ability to . complete the mission when working as a team is essential,' Lt Barger told Medium. But not all of the pilots-in-training were happy to wear the patch. One commenter on brony site Equestria Daily, who has a son in class 14-04, witnessed a few trainees unhappy with the design. 'There . was at least one non-brony who straight up refused to wear it and I . overheard another complaining to his mom about it,' the commenter wrote. 'But the fight instructor (who was a captain) was wearing it and he had . no problems with his masculinity.' These discontent pilots may be reluctant to wear a patch that connects them to the real group of military bronies. Passion: These military men call themselves 'Bronies' as they wear patches on their uniforms identifying themselves as fans of the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic . The show's fanbase among members of the military began about two years ago when the show first began to air. Nearly 9,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook page called 'Military Bronies.' The page highlights various members of the military in patrol situations while wearing the My Little Pony patch. There are variations of the patch that typically include a cloud with a red, yellow and blue lightning bolt. 'Worth protecting': The show geared toward young girls has had a fanbase among members of the military, which started about three years ago when the show first began to air . The design symbolizes a 'rainbow dash,' which is used on the show. Administrators of the Facebook page said today that they do not advocate for servicemen to use the patches, especially if it goes against the rules of the military. On the Facebook page, an administrator said: 'Regardless of how easy it is for others to claim this, we DO NOT promote wearing of unauthorized patches, badges or insignia on your uniform. 'We do not recommend you do ANYTHING that goes against the regulations of your branch of service.' Together: The phenomenon came to light as men in uniform joined the 4,000 fans gathered at the 2012 BronyCon. The most recent BronyCon in Baltimore, Maryland attracted 8,000 attendees . A spokeswoman for the Pentagon told FoxNews.com that the military does not support unauthorized patches on uniforms. One soldier, Ken 'Derpy' Catlin, defended the fanbase and its connection to the military. He said: 'You, the bronies, have taught me that there are things and people worth protecting; things bigger and more important than myself.' A National Guard member named Darius told Buzzfeed.com that he was amazed to see how welcoming other fans were at a brony convention. 'We barely made it up to the top steps and everyone outside was cheering for us,' he said. 'I started clapping because I figured if everyone else was clapping I’d do it too. Then my friend was like, \"no dude, they’re clapping for us.\"' 'Cheering': Military members have said that their passion for My Little Pony has been received with great acceptance by others and has strengthened their beliefs in the military . The first BronyCon held in June 2011 and attracted only about 100 people who trickled into some . meeting rooms in Manhattan. But the fanbase has grown exponentially and the most recent BronyCon held in Baltimore, Maryland last weekend had an attendance of about 8,000. Ongoing: My Little Pony has been around longer than the start of its current show as Hasbro released the first toys in 1983, leading to television specials, a movie and a TV series . In 1983, Hasbro released the first My Little Pony toys, which became popular among young girls, leading to television specials, a movie and the first TV series that ran from 1986 to 1987. The brand stuck around through the years, languishing in relative anonymity. But all that changed when Hasbro hired animator Lauren Faust, who breathed new life into the My Little Pony concept by creating the Friendship is Magic series. Faust had worked on The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends before dreaming up the land of Equestria, where My Little Pony characters like Twilight Sparkle, Apple Jack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie get go on exciting adventures.", "reference": "The class patch for a new batch of Air Force pilots plays on the show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'\nThe patch is an allusion to the subculture of 'bronies' who are male fans of the show .\nA growing amount of military men have been showing up to brony conventions .\nA spokesman for the base says the patch was designed as a joke ."}

{"id": 15075, "article": "Neil Lennon was unveiled as Bolton’s new manager on Monday and admitted he was growing frustrated waiting to be offered a route back into management following his success at Celtic. The 43-year-old Irishman won three league titles and two Scottish Cups during his four-year spell in charge at Parkhead and also guided Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League in 2012 on the back of a stunning home win over Barcelona. Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon has been officially unveiled as Bolton boss on Monday . Lennon takes over at the Macron Stadium after leaving Scottish Champions Celtic in the summer . Celtic: 2010-2014 . Games: 228 . Wins: 159 . Draws: 30 . Losses: 39 . After quitting in May to pursue other opportunities, however, Lennon has missed out on the managerial vacancies at Southampton, Crystal Palace, Norwich, Cardiff and Leeds. He withdrew from the running to take over at Huddersfield Town and would have held talks with Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad had visa issues not prevented him from travelling. When it was suggested yesterday his achievements at Celtic, particularly in the Champions League, deserved more recognition, he replied: ‘You should tell that to some of the Premier League chairmen! ‘Maybe it (Scottish football) is looked down upon a little bit but we did some great things in the Champions League. The Scot, talking to the press on Monday, has a huge task at Bolton but is relishing the tough challenge ahead . Bolton are currently rooted to the bottom of the Championship but will hope Lennon can turn around results . ‘You do get a bit antsy when jobs are coming up and they pass you by. You’re thinking, “I don’t want to leave it too much longer”. I’ve been lucky in that it’s just been six months. But sooner or later it’s in your blood and you want to get back.’ Lennon accepted the offer of a three-year deal worth £600,000-a-year to succeed Dougie Freedman at Bolton, who are bottom of the Championship with just one win from 11 games. Since dropping out of the Premier League in 2012, the club’s debts have risen to £163.8million and there will not be much money to strengthen the squad. Lennon insists plenty of prominent managers have had to prove themselves in the Championship. ‘Look at the Premier League now. You’ve got Brendan Rodgers, Roberto Martinez, Paul Lambert, Steve Bruce — the list is endless of managers who have managed in the Championship. You probably have to earn your spurs to get there.’ Lennon (left) stamped his mark on his squad by ordering three players to remove hats during his first training session. He ended up wearing Owen Garvan’s hat himself. ‘I was cold, yeah, but I don’t want players training in hats because you don’t play in hats,’ said Lennon. ‘I’m not a bully, I’m not a dictator. But I will demand they come in and train and do things the right way.’ Lennon (right) formerly worked alongside Johan Mjallby at Celtic Park and the pair will now reunite at Bolton .

Kate Moss is said to be so famous because she created an air of mystery by remaining silent. And Pippa Middleton was fast re-creating a devoted army of fans based on enchanting looks alone. However, the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge has finally spoken on camera after completing one of the toughest cross-country skiing events in the world yesterday. Scroll down for video. 'I'm average': Pippa Middleton spoke to the cameras after completing a cross-country ski race . Beginner: Cross-country novice Pippa arrived in Sweden a week ahead of the race to get in some practice . The 28-year-old – who had never done . any cross-country skiing before – braved sub-zero temperatures during . the 56-mile challenge in Western Sweden. When she was quizzed over her efforts, Pippa told the reporter she found the race 'tiring'.

At ease: A natural on skis, Pippa soon picks up the cross-country technique . Arriving in Sweden a week before the race, Pippa and her brother James got kitted out with skis and poles and hit the snow to get to grips with the discipline. Already a keen skier, Pippa was at ease with the equipment - but nonetheless struggled to keep her balance on some of the course's more challenging parts. She looked determined to master the art, spending her time ahead of the race practising the rhythmic swinging of the arms and smooth leg movements necessary for the kind of efficient and high-speed skiing style needed to earn her a decent place in the pecking order.

But sweating it out on skis did not mean her exacting sartorial standards had to slip.

Pippa, wrote on her charity page: 'My brother and I are raising money for Magic Breakfast, a small registered charity that fights child hunger through breakfast clubs' Miss Middleton, who turned up with immaculate hair and make-up, started . the race with a white hat but ended it in a fetching orange one, which she co-ordinated with her sunglasses and shoes. She crossed the finish line after seven hours, 13 minutes and 36 seconds – described by veterans as a ‘very impressive’ time. When asked if she minded finishing 26 minutes behind her brother, she replied: ‘No, that was probably fair.’ Despite being a beginner at cross country skiing, Pippa marched powerfully along the tough course . Pippa was a natural on the course, onlookers said . Pippa joined 15,800 other skiiers for the gruelling race . Pippa was inundated with requests for interviews after completing the race . The party planner explained she had ‘never really skied cross-country . before’, but said she and James, 23, had done ‘lots of fitness training’ in the UK to prepare for the race, as well as two weekends spent skiing . in Switzerland. During the race – much of which was uphill – Miss Middleton stopped to . drink the local blabarsoppa, or blueberry soup, a drink handed out to . racers which is said to boost energy.

{"id": 15077, "article": "(CNN) -- Prince Harry is currently in Cape Town awaiting an improvement in weather conditions so that he, along with his fellow Walking With The Wounded teammates, can fly to Antarctica's Novo Airbase and begin acclimating their bodies to the extreme conditions before their 200-mile trek to the South Pole. By committing to head to the bottom of the earth alongside his team, Harry is setting a whole new precedent in terms of royal charity involvement for the future. Members of the royal family serve to provide continuity, promote British interests, and act as global ambassadors by representing all that is great about Great Britain, but a large percentage of their operational life is devoted to charity work. For decades royals have travelled the length and breadth of the country, and indeed the globe, on behalf of their many organizations. They act as patron or president, raise awareness of the cause, cut ribbons, unveil plaques, attend dinners, plant trees, and most importantly -- raise money. A royal patronage is about the best gift a charity can receive short of a wealthy benefactor bequeathing millions of dollars to the cause on their death bed, and in times of recession and economic hardship the survival of many charities rests on the regal shoulders of its patron. At 87 the Queen has more than 600 patronages and at 92 Prince Philip has about 800. According to a recent Time magazine article, Prince Charles raised $224 million for his charities between April 2012 and March 2013. Tickets to the upcoming Winter Whites Gala on behalf of homeless charity Centrepoint were going for the princely sum of Â£500 before selling out almost immediately. The reason for the large price tag and instant sell out? Prince William, Patron of Centrepoint, will be in attendance. Charities can command top dollar when a senior royal rolls out. Along with said royal comes a legion of reporters and wealthy benefactors, and whenever Kate's involved you can pretty much guarantee the occasion making front page news the following day. That type of attention leaves charity heads googly-eyed. The royals have always approached charity engagements with enthusiasm, well aware that their presence allows for worldwide exposure. One need only to look at coverage of Diana shaking hands with an AIDS patient in 1989, or her walk through a partially-cleared land mine field in Angola in 1997, to understand the power of a globally recognized figure. William and Harry, however, have taken things one step further in recent years by rolling up their proverbial sleeves and throwing themselves in at ground level. In December 2009 Prince William spent the night sleeping rough near Blackfriars Bridge in central London. He did so in order to gain a better understanding of what the homeless community experiences night after night. Had he simply dished out soup and shaken hands with a few volunteers he still would have drawn attention to the work of the charity Centrepoint, but by actually bedding down on the streets of Central London he significantly heightened public awareness. In March 2011 Prince Harry joined a team of injured servicemen for the first five days of their trek to the North Pole. Yes, of course it was about raising money for the charity Walking With The Wounded, but as Harry said at the time, it was also about raising an awareness of the debt the country owes to those it sends off to fight. Harry has made no secret of his dedication to the welfare of injured servicemen and women, and the money raised enables the charity to fulfill its mission; however, by taking part alongside his fellow soldiers, Harry gave them far more than a well-funded charity. He showed them that they matter, that their loss matters, and that their lives may continue to inspire. Looking to the future of the monarchy, Charles has made it clear he wants to push for a more streamlined royal family, but I hope that when the time comes he will make room for extended members of the family to step up and continue their efforts on behalf of their chosen charities. As the only blood-born princesses of their generation, Beatrice and Eugenie have already shown a readiness to support causes meaningful to them. Were the Queen to give them an \"official\" role, their potential could be enormous. It comes down to simple mathematics: streamline the monarchy, and funding to the smaller charities that rely on a royal patron slips down the tubes. Royals and charity work will always go hand-in-hand -- and long may it be so. Plaques will remain, trees will grow, and the work of the charity in question will continue, but it is this new hardcore approach that is so exciting. It won't work for everyone, and it would lose its impact if suddenly every engagement required rigorous training, compression chambers, hard hats, life vests and the likes, but we should salute Prince Harry on his epic polar endeavor. Harry's physical disability may be limited to a broken toe, but walking alongside those brave wounded warriors will no doubt leave him with an unbreakable spirit.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms. Mr Wen said that the changes are needed to prevent China's economy from faltering and to spread wealth more evenly. He vowed to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent that he warned could end in chaos - and may even see a new Cultural Revolution. Call for change: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms . The reference was to the tumultuous period between 1966 and 1976 when Chairman Mao Zedong persecuted members of his own Communist Party in a desperate bid to reimpose his iron rule. In a three-hour news conference, his sole such event of the year, Mr Wen said: 'A historical tragedy like the Cultural Revolution could occur again. Each party member and cadre should feel a sense of urgency.' Mr Wen renewed a call for unspecified political reforms, particularly of the Communist Party leadership, saying that without them China's hard-won prosperity might fizzle. The Cultural Revolution, also known by its full title of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, took place in China between 1966 and 1976. It was set in motion by Chairman Mao Zedong (pictured) of the Communist Party in May 1966 to combat what he saw as corrosive Western influences. This was done by removing cultural, capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The revolution saw Mao regain his iron rule, but affected the country both economically and socially. 'Revisionists' suspected of trying to filter Western elements into Chinese society were removed through violence. It is estimated that up to 1.5million people were killed during the struggle, although a true figure will never be known. Roughly the same number suffered permanent injuries. The tumultuous period ended following Mao's death in 1976. He said: 'Reform has reached a critical stage. Without the success of political reform, economic reforms cannot be carried out. The results that we have achieved may be lost.' No democratic firebrand, Mr Wen has issued similarly vague pleas before - and become a popular if lone voice among senior leaders by doing so. This time his tone was more emphatic, as was the setting. The news conference was his last scheduled briefing before the prim 69-year-old steps down in a year after a decade in office. He said he is 'seized by a strong sense of responsibility' to speak out and referred repeatedly to the judgement of history. The recurring references to the past and the wistful, reflective tone turned the premier's news conference into something of a swan song for the most popular member of the usually remote leadership. Sometimes called 'Grandpa Wen', he comes across as warm and caring. He has been shown eating dumplings with coal miners and consoling survivors of the devastating Sichuan earthquake and other disasters. As the number three in the party leadership who is primarily responsible for the economy, Mr Wen fielded a range of questions, from local government debt to currency reform. He offered Chinese funding of U.S. infrastructure projects to create American jobs and rebalance lopsided economic ties with a crucial trading partner. He sidestepped a question asking his views of the democratic uprisings in parts of the Arab world. Mr Wen sounded resolute on government . efforts to deflate a property bubble, saying 'home prices in China are . far from coming back to a reasonable level'. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets swooned, bucking the trend in markets elsewhere buoyed by strong Wall Street gains. Sometimes called 'Grandpa Wen', the premier comes across as warm and caring. He made his comments during a three-hour news conference in Beijing . Mr Wen, President Hu Jintao and most of the leadership are stepping down to hew to unwritten rules of succession and make way for younger leaders. The turnover always invites divisive infighting that the party prefers to keep under wraps. He retires next year along with President Hu Jintao after a decade in power which has seen China grow to become the world's second-biggest economy, but which is likely to see 2012 deliver the slowest rate of annual growth during their leadership. A reflective Mr Wen said: 'Due to my incompetent abilities and institutional and other factors, there is still much room for improvement in my work. 'I should assume responsibility for the problems that have occurred in China's economy and society during my term in office for which I feel truly sorry.'", "reference": "Wen Jiabao vows to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent he says could end in chaos .\nHe warns China could see a new Cultural Revolution ."}

Ennis, chief medical officer of the Baptist Health System, said Tuesday in a statement. She was referring to the infection caused by rod-shaped bacteria that were discovered in bags used in intravenous feeding -- also referred to as total parenteral nutrition. The infection would have entered the bloodstream easily and \"with a pretty quick effect in terms of blood pressure and temperature,\" said Dr. Donald Williamson of the Alabama Department of Public Health in a conference call Tuesday night with reporters. But the products no longer pose a threat to anyone who has not already been identified, he added. It was not clear how many people in all had been administered the solution, he said. The infected IV bags have been removed from the hospitals and the product has been recalled, he said. \"For the pharmacy and these patients, this is now a closed loop,\" he said. \"The bigger challenge is how did this happen, and what can be done to reduce the risk of contamination in the future.\" The nutrition product, which was recalled last Thursday, was made by Birmingham, Alabama-based Meds IV, which did not respond to phone calls left Tuesday and Wednesday; its website was offline on Wednesday. Of the five patients at Shelby Baptist Medical Center who were infected, two died; of the seven infected at Princeton Baptist Medical Center, four died, Ennis said. Of two cases at Select Specialty Hospital, one died; of three cases at Medical West Hospital, one died; the one case at Baptist Prattville proved fatal, but the one case at Cooper Green Hospital did not die, said Dr. Jim McVay, director of healthy promotion and chronic disease for the Alabama Health Department. Baptist Prattville, 80 miles south of Birmingham, was the sole hospital outside the Birmingham area. The outbreak was identified March 16 when two hospitals reported unusual cases of bacteria among high-risk patients -- an outbreak that had begun in late January, according to McVay. Patients who get the product are typically already very sick, McVay said. Williamson praised those involved. \"This is actually the way the system should work,\" he said. \"In this case, a couple of hospitals identified that they were seeing what they perceived to be an unusual number of cases of serratia marcescens bacteremia. \"When they saw that, they contacted us and the CDC and we contacted the CDC and very quickly you got the shutoff of the production of the product, the cessation of use of the product and then you quickly got an investigation done to identify both what the most likely source was as well as where the source came from and some idea of the magnitude of the problem.\" CNN's Craig Bell contributed to this report .", "reference": "NEW: \"We don't know, and may never know,\" says chief medical officer of the Baptist Health System .\nThe investigation is ongoing .\nThe outbreak was reported March 16 .\nThe product was recalled Thursday and no longer poses a threat, a state health official says ."}

'When I arrived at work the next day, Robin noticed that I was upset and asked me what was wrong. I explained what had happened, and the next day, he handed me a letter that he wrote to my school. 'He explained that I was just trying to continue my education while pursuing my career.

Bogus nurse: Denice Stewart has been spared jail after admitting theft, fraud, deception and forgery after posing as a registered nurse for six years . A woman with no medical training stole the identity of a nurse and spent six years carrying out hundreds of smear tests and vaccinations in GP surgeries, a court heard yesterday. When Denice Stewart, 48, was finally arrested in July 2011, patients she had treated, many of them children, had to be offered retests and additional treatment. During her sentencing for fraud yesterday, the judge accused Stewart of a ‘gross breach of trust’ but did not jail her. He also criticised the Nursing and Midwifery Council for failing to investigate immediately when suspicions of the deception were raised as early as 2005. In total, Stewart performed 1,100 vaccinations and 686 smear tests while working at three surgeries in Kent between 2006 and 2010. Of 951 vaccinations she carried out at one practice, 515 were for children. During a previous job in Essex, she gave 67 jabs and carried out 46 smear tests. The opportunity for her crime presented itself when she bought a house in Essex from nurse Amaya Lloyd-Johnson, who had moved to Canada but had neglected to inform the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which holds a register of all nurses and midwives. Stewart received an application in the post addressed to Mrs Lloyd-Johnson asking her to renew her membership to the NMC. Instead of passing it on, Stewart completed it herself, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Alan Gardner, prosecuting, said: ‘She dishonestly adopted the identity of a nurse.  She worked at several general practice surgeries around the country carrying out a number of medical procedures which she was not qualified to undertake.’ Hearing: Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard Stewart vaccinated 1,167 adults and children and tested 732 women for cervical cancer while working unsupervised as a bogus nurse . He added: ‘The NMC didn’t check as . closely or fully as perhaps they should’ve done that the documents that . were sent to them were from Mrs Lloyd-Johnson. ‘The defendant stole the mail which arrived and used the contents to begin establishing herself as a fraudulent nurse.’ Mrs Lloyd-Johnson soon became aware . that her registration was being used by someone called Stewart and . alerted the NMC. But nothing was done and Stewart continued her fraud. Fraud: Stewart hatched her plan in August 2002 after stealing mail which belonged to a genuine nurse who used to live in the Darlington home that she had recently bought . Over the years, Stewart made several . requests to change the name on her NMC identity card, each time making . it more closely resemble her own. She then moved to Wales, where she . worked as an auxiliary nurse, which does not require an NMC card. However she quickly applied for a registered general nurse job when one . became available. Mr Gardner said: ‘She was becoming at that stage increasingly ambitious in terms of the work she was seeking.’ But when her employer at the Brecon . Medical Centre in South Wales examined her identity card, he realised it . had been tampered with and informed the NMC. In 2011, the NMC finally cancelled her registration number. She was later arrested by police. Peter Alcock, defending, said that . Stewart was a ‘fragile, vulnerable, damaged individual’ who had suffered . gynaecological problems and had tried to commit suicide. He said the motivation for her crime, . which earned her nearly £74,000 over the years, was not economic, but . due to ‘low self-esteem and low self-worth’. Sentencing her to 20 months’ imprisonment suspended for two years, Judge Carey said: ‘You were . inhabiting a world in which you were deceiving others and deceiving . yourself.’ He added: ‘I reach the conclusion . that uppermost in your mind was the desire to have a status which you . had not earned and you did not deserve in order to beset your low . self-esteem and against a backdrop of an unhappy domestic life.’ Stewart had admitted eight charges, . mostly relating to fraud but also theft and forging of documents and . profiting from her role.", "reference": "Denice Stewart spared jail after admitting posing as a registered nurse .\nHatched plan after stealing mail belonging to a genuine nurse in 2002 .\nJudge criticises Nursery and Midwifery Council for their investigations .\nStewart evaded 'limited if non-existent' inquiries by the NMC ."}

{"id": 15085, "article": "Jerusalem (CNN) -- The executive director of the organization sending a Libyan-backed ship laden with humanitarian goods to Gaza -- in violation of an Israeli blockade -- said Tuesday that the ship's captain has no plans to alter course. \"We confirm that the ship is definitely heading to Gaza; we have no other destination other than Gaza,\" Gadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation's Yusuf Sawani told CNNI in a telephone interview from Tripoli, Libya. \"This is where we think humanitarian assistance and relief material should go.\" Sawani said he was speaking hourly with those aboard the ship, which was located some 60 to 70 km (37 to 43 miles) from Gaza. It was due to arrive at the Palestinian territory about 10 a.m. Wednesday, he said. The Israeli navy has approached the vessel and given the chief of mission and the ship's captain an ultimatum: Divert to the Egyptian port of al-Arish, he said. \"But our answer will remain as always,\" he said. \"We started sailing toward Gaza and Gaza is our target, and we hope that every party concerned will come to their senses and  realize that this is a humanitarian, peaceful mission.\" He added, \"This is not a propaganda stunt.\" Sawani said Sunday that the activists on the boat would not resist if confronted by the Israeli military. Earlier Tuesday, an Israeli official with knowledge of the communications between the Israeli military and the vessel said the ship's captain had agreed to change course and go to Egypt instead. An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hossam Zaki, said Egypt is prepared to grant the Libyan ship docking rights. \"We haven't received an official request yet but if we do we will grant permission,\" Zaki said. The Israel Defense Forces had said its navy earlier was making \"preparations to stop\" the ship from delivering aid directly to Gaza, in violation of an Israeli blockade. The IDF asked the ship to change course for the Egyptian port of al-Arish, a military spokesman told CNN, adding that the military had not intercepted or boarded the ship. Israel came under fierce international criticism for killing nine Turkish activists in the course of boarding a Gaza-bound ship in May. Israel said the activists attacked its troops when they boarded the boat. The new aid ship was launched by a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. It set sail from Greece on Saturday carrying 2,000 tons of aid. Israel says it must inspect all goods that enter Gaza so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement. The Gadhafi Foundation refers to the ship as the Hope, although it appears to be registered as the MV Amalthea. It is Moldovan-flagged and run by ACA Shipping, based in Greece. Sawani said thatin addition to the crew members, nine others were on board: Six Libyans, one Moroccan and one person from Niger, all of whom work with the Gadhafi Foundation, plus a journalist from the Al Jazeera network. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak Sunday called the ship \"an unnecessary provocation.\" Barak said Israel would not allow the aid ship to dock in Gaza, but said it could unload goods elsewhere and Israel would allow them to enter the Palestinian territory by land after Israel inspects them. \"Goods can be transferred into Gaza through the port of Ashdod after they are inspected, but we will not allow the transfer of weapons or ammunition into Gaza,\" he said. \"We recommend to the organizers ... to allow navy vessels to escort it to the port of Ashdod or sail directly to al-Arish\" in Egypt. A report Monday on the findings of an Israeli military investigation into the boarding of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara in May, in which nine people were killed, criticized some aspects of the operation. The operation prepared only one course of action and had no backup plan, military commanders were not presented with options other than boarding the ship, and different branches of military intelligence did not coordinate well enough, the report found. But the report said the commando team that boarded the ship operated properly, with bravery and professionalism, and that the use of live fire was justified. Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, upheaval continued in Gaza on Tuesday evening, when the Israeli military fired at least one shell into a house in Gaza, Palestinian security and medics said. The dead included a woman and the injured included two women and two children from the the Al-Bureij neighborhood  in central Gaza, medics said. An IDF spokesman said its forces identified suspected militants along a security fence and fired on them; reports of casualties were under investigation. CNN's Izzy Lemberg and Talal Abu-Rahma and Paul Colsey contributed to this report.", "reference": "Gadhafi charity's executive director says the ship is bound for Gaza .\nIsraeli navy has given the ship an ultimatum .\nEarlier Tuesday, an Israeli official said the captain had agreed to divert to Egypt .\nThe ship was sent by the Gadhafi Foundation, which is run by the son of Libya's leader ."}
{"id": 15086, "article": "By . Chris Greenwood . Police enjoyed free tickets for eight years to watch a top Premier League side at the centre of an anti-corruption inquiry. Dozens of officers and staff took advantage of six Arsenal season tickets provided by the wealthy North London club. The deal will deepen concerns about the cosy relationship between it and the Metropolitan Police. Earlier this month the Daily Mail revealed star player Mesut Ozil faces questions over how three Scotland Yard detectives ended up in his private box at a match. The freebie: Detective Sergeant Simon Jones (left) and Mesut Ozil (second left) in the player’s box at the Emirates with a youth, an unidentified fan and Detective Constable Helen Nicolson (far right), who was not involved in the investigation . Just 24 hours earlier some of them were tasked with speaking to him after his car collided with a photographer outside his home. Senior politicians tasked with overseeing the Met said the season ticket deal raises worrying questions about the impartiality of police. Baroness Jenny Jones said: ‘Accepting hospitality like this gives the impression that not everyone is equal before the law and that favours can be bought.’ The ticket deal began in 2005 when Arsenal agreed to hand over six season tickets every year to police in the London borough of Islington. The sought-after seats were handed out on a ‘match-by-match’ basis to officers and staff as a reward for good work, the Met said. It is not known how much the tickets were worth, but the cheapest Arsenal season ticket for the 2014/15 season is £985 and the most expensive almost £2,000. Helen Nicolson was photographed grinning as she shook hands with Ozil . Probe: Football superstar Ozil on the night of the incident. Freelance photographer Lee Essex dialled 999 claiming Ozil had driven his Porsche into him, knocking his arm with a wing mirror . But the hospitality, worth tens of thousands of pounds, was abruptly stopped when a new area chief took charge last year. The season ticket deal was revealed as questions over the conduct of Arsenal and World Cup final star Ozil remain unanswered. The German faces being quizzed on his return to London over the presence of three detectives in his private box at a match in February. Just 24 hours earlier a police inquiry was launched when a photographer claimed he was assaulted by the star after being hit by his car. Mesut Ozil (centre) scores for Arsenal in the Premier League against Newcastle United last season . Two of the detectives at the match are believed to have been asked to assist that investigation which was dropped within weeks. Bureaucrats in a traffic office wrote to the photographer to tell him the inquiry was over and blamed the lack of ‘independent evidence’. All three detectives, who were initially suspended from frontline duties, face being questioned under caution later this month for potential misconduct. Colleagues insist the trio are guilty of nothing more than ‘stupidity’ but chiefs are concerned their actions may have brought the force into disrepute. The tickets were not the only gestures of goodwill from Arsenal to the police force. It donated a £640 camera to its football liaison team and gave police use of two vehicles, a Citroen Dispatch van and a Saab car. The force also paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the cost of policing matches at its Emirates ground. Caroline Pidgeon, a London Lib Dem politician, said: ‘Before accepting any hospitality every police officer should ask fundamental questions as to whether acceptance is good for policing and how it would be perceived by the public. ‘It seems staggering that for so long a number of police officers in Islington completely failed to ask such basic questions and ignored the Met’s own gifts and hospitality rules.’ The misconduct probe is a potential embarrassment for Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, a Sheffield Wednesday fan who regularly plays competitive 5-a-side. Earlier this month he led a conference at the Emirates Stadium for some of the force’s most senior officers. Up to 800 chief inspectors and superintendents attended an event at the Arsenal ground aimed at improving the working culture of the force. A Met spokesman said: ‘Between 2005 and early 2013, Arsenal FC donated approximately six season tickets per year to Islington Borough. ‘These tickets were used on a match by match basis to recognise good work and community spirited work undertaken by police officers and staff and members of the public. ‘The allocation of the tickets was recorded on the borough and there was senior officer oversight. ‘In February 2013 the arrangement was reviewed by the new borough commander and stopped.’ An Arsenal spokesman said: ‘We have always worked closely with the Metropolitan Police who are hugely important to our activities and the safe running of our matches. 'The tickets were provided for the force to use at their discretion under the oversight of a senior officer.’", "reference": "Dozens of officers and staff took advantage of six Arsenal season tickets .\nDeal deepens concerns about cosy relationship between club and force .\nIt follows questions asked about Mesut Ozil entertaining three officers .\nJust 24 hours earlier some of them spoke to him about a car crash ."}
{"id": 15087, "article": "(CNN) -- His journey started in Nigeria, a taunted teenager with large tumors on his face, driven into deep despair. Eleven years later, Victor Chukwueke has undergone numerous surgeries and is a step closer to achieving his dream of becoming a doctor. In a rare act, the United States Congress passed a private bill last week granting Chukwueke permanent residency after years of his living in Michigan on an expired visa. The bill is awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. \"The day Congress passed the bill was one of the happiest days of my life,\" says Chukwueke, who left Nigeria as a teen in 2001 to get treatment for the tumors. Private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- seldom pass. His is the only private bill to pass in Congress in two years. \"I was overwhelmed with joy; it was nothing less than a miracle,\" the 26-year-old says. \"Only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like me.\" Before coming to the United States at age 15, Chukwueke lived in the southeastern Nigeria town of Ovim. He suffers from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes massive life-threatening tumors on his face. Treated as an outcast because of his deformed face, he was depressed and humiliated, he says. His family abandoned him at an orphanage. Nuns from the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy rescued him from the orphanage more than a decade ago and arranged for a Michigan doctor to perform surgery on him. He says he considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors. \"Without them, I would not have met the nun, left Nigeria, arrived in the U.S. and had the miracle to attend medical school,\" he says. He lives with the nuns in Oak Park, Michigan. They have cared for him since he came to the U.S., where he has undergone seven surgeries, including one that left him blind in the right eye. Doctors performed Chukwueke's surgeries over a period of time, he says, which contributed to his expired visa. Despite the obstacles, he remains committed to getting an education. \"My own personal struggles to receive treatment have motivated and encouraged me to pursue a medical career ... to alleviate the pain and suffering of others,\" he says. \"A medical career will allow me many gratifying years of making a difference in the health and lives of others. I strongly believe one can make another person's life worthy of living ... I have experienced it.\" He finished his GED -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college. A benefactor later helped him attend Wayne State University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and chemical biology last year. He had a 3.82 GPA and gave the university's commencement speech. \"Should I call myself a victim, or should I press forward to my dreams?\" he asked during the speech amid thunderous applause. Soon after his graduation, the University of Toledo in Ohio admitted him to medical school. The only hurdle: The program requires him to have permanent residency status, also known as a green card. Though he qualifies for the DREAM Act, which gives immigrants who came to the United States as minors temporary residency, the measure would not give him the permanent status mandated by the university, according to his attorney. And so began Chukwueke's journey to get legalized, a quest that has seen strangers rally to his help. His attorney Thomas K. Ragland took his case pro bono. \"Victor's story is remarkable,\" says Ragland, who is based in Washington D.C. \"Here is this kid who comes from Nigeria, he was taunted and teased for his diseases, and he comes to this country and excels, despite so many surgeries. It is a testament of not letting anything get in the way.\" Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, sponsored the bill, S. 285. The measure passed the Senate in the summer and the House last week . \"Already, his example has enriched Michigan and our nation, but I know that his contributions to our country are only beginning,\" Levin said in a statement. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States was estimated at 11.5 million last year. If Obama signs the bill, the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians. That signature, Chukwueke says, will be his favorite holiday gift.", "reference": "Victor Chukwueke's visa expires after he comes to the U.S. for treatment of tumors .\nMichigan senator introduces a private bill to grant him a green card .\nBill comes after he's admitted to a medical school that requires students to have a green card .\nIn a rare act, Congress passes the bill last week ."}

The shadow chancellor rejected claims from former top referee Graham Poll who said he was lucky not to have been sent off after elbowing Northern Echo reporter Rob Merrick in the face. Miss Cooper, the shadow home secretary, demanded to know 'what went on' after the incident, and joked that it undermines her determination to be 'tough on anti-social behaviour'. Reporter Rob Merrick was sporting a black eye today, after his clash with Ed Balls on Sunday, but during media interviews this morning (right) the shadow chancellor insisted it was not a foul . Mr Balls' wife Yvette Cooper, who was in the audience for his conference speech today, joked that the incident undermined her attempts to be tough on anti-social behaviour . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls tackles journalist Rob Merick as they take part in the Labour MPs v Lobby Journalists football match . Merrick was left with blood pouring down his face, and later needed four stitches at A&E . Mr Balls insisted there were no hard feelings, and he and Mr Merrick remain 'good friends' despite the clash . The nasty clash occurred during the traditional pre-conference football match between Labour and political journalists. The pair were contesting a 50-50 ball on the edge of the Lobby penalty area when a stray elbow from Mr Balls left a slash under the reporter's right eye. Mr Merrick had to leave the pitch for medical treatment as blood covered his shirt - but later returned to be named man-of-the-match. Challenged about the incident today, Mr Balls admitted his wife had demanded an explanation: 'Yvette saw those pictures and said 'what went on'?' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Balls added: 'It was a clash, a coming together. It was n malice. It wasn't even a foul. We didn't even know it had happened. 'The referee not only said it wasn't a foul, but everybody else knew it wasn't a foul. It was a complete accident. 'Rob and I, we're good friends, there's not hard feeling between us. But I have to say to you it's not a good picture.' However, former top referee Graham Poll insisted he should have been sent off. 'Had I been refereeing this match, I would have certainly voted Yes for a straight red card for Ed Balls. ‘As the pictures show, Ed deliberately brought his arm and elbow into the face of Rob Merrick – a clear foul and an obvious sending off. ‘But if you need further evidence, you only need to look at the blood that flowed after the incident. ‘Not only did we have a man representing the red of the Labour Party – his challenge left plenty of red on his opponent’s shirt and that’s why my card definitely would have been red for Ed.’ Mr Balls tried to present a softer image this morning with a visit to a nursery in Manchester . He was joined by shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves at Asbury Meadow SureStart centre . Mr Balls hopes to use his Labour conference speech today to prove to voters that he can be trusted with the economy . Photographs of the elbowing have been circulated online and appeared on the front pages of several newspapers today. Miss Cooper, who is in charge of Labour's policy on law and order, suggested the violence could be a setback for the party's stance against thuggery. She told a Labour List conference rally: 'Some of you may have seen the photographs of Ed and his encounter on a football match earlier. 'When he came back he said, 'well, there was a bit of an incident - a journalist ran into my arm. Well, all right, so he ran into my elbow ...with his eye'.' She told the audience: 'So when you see the photographs of all the blood and the grimaces… it does rather undermine my determination to be tough on anti-social behaviour.' The Labour team - which featured a host of frontbench stalwarts including Andy Burnham, Jim Murphy and Sadiq Khan - eventually suffered the pain of a 3-1 defeat. Graeme Demianyk of the Western Morning News opened the scoring by bundling home from close range, before the Financial Times's George Parker doubled the advantage. But a strike from political aide Dave Hodges sparked a shaky spell from the Lobby, and it took a goal from Matt Dathan of The Times to settle the issue. It is the second year running the Labour team has been defeated in the conference showdown, which is supported by the Football Association and helps raise funds for charity.", "reference": "Shadow chancellor caught Northern Echo reporter Rob Merrick with elbow .\nMerrick left the pitch to get patched up by St John's Ambulance crew .\nWas left with blood pouring down his face after clash with 'Bruiser' Balls .\nHis wife Yvette Cooper demanded an explanation after seeing photos .\nShadow home secretary jokes it undermines tough law and order syance ."}

The muggy weather is creating a ‘perfect storm’ for mosquitoes to descend on our gardens. But the latest high-tech weapon in the battle against the bloodsuckers doesn’t come in the form or a spray or clip, instead it’s a free app on your smartphone. Anti-mosquito apps emit ultrasonic frequencies designed to frighten the mosquitoes away. They do this by either mimicking the sounds of mosquito predators, such as dragonflies and bats, or by using the sound made by the wings of male insects. Once a female mosquito has mated, she is said to actively avoid contact with males, so by playing this sound, the females stay away. The most popular app is called the Anti Mosquito Sonic Repeller. Its developers claim that the pitch of the sound it produces is so high, most humans don’t notice it. It also comes with various frequencies in order to target different mosquito species within specific locations. Although, the app does not guarantee 100 per cent protection, because ‘there are more than 3,500 known mosquito species in the world and they all react slightly different to the repellent’. Other apps that play ‘mosquito sounds’ are designed to annoy people, rather than repel mosquitoes but have been found to serve that purpose by accident. The official name for such apps, and other similar technologies, is electronic mosquito repellents, or EMRs. Experts have expressed concern about using these apps as a standalone repellent, however. Research from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine found ‘no evidence of an effect of EMRs on landing rates.

'Thus there is no evidence that these EMRs could potentially be useful in preventing malaria in humans.’ There is also said to be little evidence female mosquitoes avoid males after they’ve mated. The Liverpool researchers added that ‘male mosquitoes are actually the ones attracted by the female flight sound, and females normally have a very weak sensitivity for sound compared with the males.’ Wayne Crans, Associate Research Professor in Entomology at Rutgers added mosquitoes are also not know to leave areas hunted by dragonflies.

If given the all-clear, she would be seen at another surgery. Hotline staff told her that the presence of the rash meant it was unlikely to be swine flu. She decided to dial 999 and the first ambulance, which was turned away, arrived at about midday. A statement of behalf of the East of England Ambulance Service was read at the start of the inquest. It said: 'The ambulance trust does recognise there have been shortcomings in this case and has apologised to the family.' He added that action has been taken to prevent future tragedies. Paramedic Patricia Perfect said she visited the family's home and made the swine flu diagnosis after a 45-minute examination. She ruled out meningitis because the rash disappeared when pressed. 'I went on the history of vomiting, the fact she was having pains and she also had a high temperature,' she added. 'Swine flu was at pandemic proportions and most clinicians at that time, if presented with those symptoms, would have come up with the same diagnosis. 'We now know I made the wrong diagnosis and I am very sorry about that. 'But because at the time we were being advised not to send people to hospital with swine flu, that is the reason I did not send her in.'", "reference": "Georgia's father tried glass test on her rash but NHS Direct told her it was probably the swine flu virus that was going around .\nGeorgia's mother called for an ambulance after she was told by swine flu hotline it was unlikely to be swine flu.

{"id": 15099, "article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Organization of the Islamic Conference on Friday added its voice to the growing criticism of a film released by a Dutch lawmaker, which features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Jeddah, Saudi Arabia-based OIC, released a statement condemning \"in the strongest terms the release of the film 'Fitna' by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders.\" The organization added that the film defamed and denigrated \"the Holy Quran, causing insult to the sentiments of more than 1.3 billion Muslims in the world. \"The film was a deliberate act of discrimination against Muslims\" that aimed to \"provoke unrest and intolerance,\" the organization said. The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations. In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law. The 15-minute film, posted Thursday on a London-based Web site, has also drawn condemnation from the European Union and others. The European Union said the film inflames hatred, and Iran's Foreign Ministry called the movie \"anti-Islamic and insulting.\" The foreign ministry called on the EU, the Netherlands, and Britain to take action to put an end to its showing, the official IRNA news agency reported. The Danish Union of Journalists said it was suing Wilders for using a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed drawn by one of its members, newspaper political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. It said Wilders used the picture -- which shows Mohammed with a turban shaped like a bomb -- without permission. The film, titled \"Fitna,\" opens with Westergaard's controversial caricature, followed by translated portions of Islam's holy book, the Quran. The passages are interspersed with graphic images of the September 11 terrorist attacks juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York and other video clips. The video includes disturbing images of other terror attacks; bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional full-body attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians. The film concludes with scrolling messages reading in part: \"The government insists that you respect Islam, but Islam has no respect for you\" and \"In 1945, Nazism was defeated in Europe. In 1989, communism was defeated in Europe. Now the Islamic ideology has to be defeated.\" Wilders, the filmmaker, is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom. He has been outspoken in his criticism of Islam and called the religion a threat to the world. \"It's not a provocation, but the harsh reality and a political conclusion,\" Wilders said of the film Thursday. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad-Ali Hosseini on Friday condemned Wilders and the UK-based Web site hosting the film, LiveLeak.com, for showing the \"provocative and anti-Islamic movie.\" \"He said such a 'dirty act' of the Dutch lawmaker and of a British institute at the end of the Islamic Unity Week reveals continued enmity and deep hostility of such western nationals against Islam and Muslims,\" IRNA reported. \"Warning against consequences of such 'provocative' acts, Hosseini asked the Dutch and British governments as well as (the) European Union to step in the case as soon as possible and prevent and put an end to showing of such (an) 'insulting, anti-Islamic and anti-cultural' film,\" IRNA wrote. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the film, calling it \"offensively anti-Islamic\" while urging calm. \"There is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence,\" he said in a statement. \"The right of free expression is not at stake here.\" Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Thursday that the film equates Islam with violence. \"We reject this interpretation,\" Balkenende said in a statement. \"The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence. In fact, the victims are often also Muslims.\" Slovenia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said Friday that it supports the Dutch government's position and believes the film does nothing to promote dialogue among religions. \"Mutual tolerance and respect are universal values we should uphold. We believe that acts, such as the above-mentioned film, serve no other purpose than inflaming hatred.\" The U.S. government warned the film could spark protests and riots. The title of the film, \"Fitna,\" translates in Arabic to \"strife\" or \"conflict\" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. LiveLeak issued a statement Thursday saying there was no legal reason not to allow Wilders to post the film. It said the site's policy is to remain unbiased and allow freedom of speech. Some in the Muslim community rejected the film as nothing more than dangerous anti-Islamic propaganda. \"This film is a direct attempt to incite violence from Muslims and help fan the flames of Islamophobia,\" Arsalan Iftikhar, a contributor to Washington-based Islamica Magazine, told CNN on Thursday. \"Any reasonable person can see this is meant to spit in the face of Muslims and insult our religion.\" Iftikhar said he doubted the film would spark the same type of violence that followed the publication of the caricature of Mohammed, but he called on Muslim leaders to react peacefully. Westergaard's caricature was one of a dozen printed in a Danish newspaper in late 2005. Violent protests erupted early the next year after other European newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech. Some Muslims believe the Quran forbids showing an image of the prophet.

{"id": 15100, "article": "The Muslim convert who attacked four police officers with a hatchet yesterday afternoon was a 'recluse' who kept two sharp axes and a hunting knife at home. Zale Thompson, 32, was shot dead yesterday after charging at the officers in Queens with a hatchet in his hands. He slashed at one policeman's head, seriously wounding him, and hurt another. And it has now emerged that Thompson kept even more dangerous weapons at home, converted to radical Islam two years ago, and that even his own family describe him as a 'recluse'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Extremist rants: Police are investigating Thompson's potential terrorist links, including social media post advocating attacks on American soil. His own family said he was a recluse who spent all day in his room . Shot dead: Zale Thompson, 32, is pictured above on the street after police officers stopped him in the midst of his attack . Weapons: Police searches found a sharpened axe and an ornate hunting knife in Thompson's home. The axe pictured is different to the one used in yesterday's attack . Police searches on Thompson's home in Queens turned up another 'weaponized' hatchet, and a long, wide-bladed hunting knife. It comes as Police Commissioner William Bratton has branded the attack a 'terrorist act', but said that Thompson did not, in fact, have any clear ties to international extremists. Following computer examinations for clues about a motive for the assault, police discovered Thompson's  browsing history included organized terror groups, beheadings and the shooting in Canada earlier this week that officials there have called a terrorist attack. However, the suspect was not on any watch lists, and officials found no indication he sought any training or affiliation to any groups, Mr Bratton said. Act if terror?: Suspect Zale Thompson can be seen swinging a hatchet towards police officers at 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon in Jamaica, Queens . Still, the commissioner said he was comfortable calling the incident a terrorist attack, saying: 'This was a terrorist attack, certainly.' But he stopped short of including the attack in the list of terror plots against the city since September 11, 2001, adding that the investigation was continuing. According to officers, Thompson was a 'recluse' who spent most of his time in his bedroom. He was described as a 'self-radicalized' Muslim who converted about two years ago. He had once served in the U.S. Navy and had a history of run-ins with the law over domestic violence in California in 2003 and 2004, police said. Investigators believe Thompson was a loner and carried out yesterday's attack without any help - though they are probing potential links to other extremists. Robert Boyce, the NYPD's Chief of Detectives, outlined the new findings at a conference today. Without warning: Zale Thompson attacked officers without warning or uttering a single word . Checkpoint: The NYPD were out in force at a subway station near the scene of the attack today . It was also revealed that Thompson has a history of six arrests - in California from 2003-2004, though he has no criminal history in New York. In the conference today, Boyce also praised the 'exceptional performance of heroic duty' by the officers who took down Thompson. The entire incident lasted just seven seconds, he said. Surveillance footage showed Thompson charging at officers, swinging his blue-handled hatchet. He was still clinging to the weapon when he was shot dead. Earlier today social media posts made by Thompson cane to light, in which he called on Muslim extremists to attack America and wage jihad. Concern: Authorities worry than more officers or public servants may be attacked in the wake of other strikes . Bloodied hatchet: The 18 and 1/2 inch hatchet is dripping with blood after Zale Thompson used it to slash a police officer in the head and the other in the arm . Commenting on a video supporting the rise of an Islamic caliphate - such as ISIS claim to have established in Iraq and Syria - Thompson asked: 'Which is better, to sit around and do nothing, or to Jihad fisabeelallah [for the cause of Allah]!' Comments from Thompson's Facebook account were also reported on Fox News, who said he posted: 'The solution is to fight. Armed struggle. Simple.' He then reportedly advocated an armed revolution, saying: 'America's military is strong abroad, but they have never faced an internal mass revolt. … They are weaker at home. We are scattered and decentralized, we can use this as an advantage. It continued: 'They will not be able to defeat our people if we use guerilla warfare. Attack their weak flanks... If you get wounded who cares. If you die who cares. Eventually they will surrender and then the war will be over.' He also spoke of a global conspiracy by 'Zionists and Christians' to suppress Islam. He wrote: 'If the Zionists and the Crusaders had never invaded and colonized the Islamic lands after WW1, then there would be no need for Jihad!' Posting elsewhere under a music video called 'No white God', he seemed to call for extremists to overthrew European governments and enslave their people. He wrote: 'They call black people racist for rejecting the oppression they suffered from whites. Listen, when black people have colonized the entire continent of Europe, enslaved its people, and sold them into bondage to foreign lands, then you can call them racist.' ISIS has continually urged its supporters to launch 'lone wolf' attacks in the West. Thompson's family, meanwhile, say they are 'shocked' by news of the attack, while neighbors say they would never have connected him with radical Islam. Social media: Thompson's Facebook profile has a verse of the Qur'an emblazoned across the top, and pictures a man in a balaclava holding weapons . Speaking to ABC7, his grandfather, Ralph Thompson, said only: 'Very shocked, his father not well.' Igeoma Simon, who lives nearby in Queens, said the Thompson he knew was a 'great guy'. He said: 'He was very positive. He helped me stay physically active at the park...I don't really know what would drive him to that.' Police say they are investigating whether Thompson's attack on the cops was linked to Islamic terrorism. ISIS has urged fighters to launch lone wolf attacks in the United States. Thompson's Facebook page features a photograph of a man dressed in Middle Eastern garb and a cover photo displaying Arabic writing. Two attacks in Canada this week by radicalized converts to Islam have killed two Canadian soldiers. In one, a man ran down two soldiers in his car in Quebec, killing one, before being shot dead. On Wednesday a convicted felon ambushed a soldier outside Canadian Parliament, fatally wounding him, before running the Parliament building and opening fire. The scene: NYPD officers shot dead a man armed with a hatchet who attacked them Thursday afternoon and critically injured a 29-year-old female bystander in the process . DNA Info reports that on Thursday afternoon a freelance photographer approached the group of rookie cops and asked to take their photograph. As the officers were posing for the camera, Thompson charged towards them swinging an 18.5 inch hatchet without uttering a single word. One 24-year-old officer was slashed in the arm. Another 25-year-old officer, Kenneth Healey, was slashed in the back of head and taken to Jamaica Hospital where he remains in a critical but stabled condition. A 29-year-old female bystander half a block away from the attack was also critically injured after being shot by an errant police round. She is currently recovering from surgery at Jamaica Hospital and is listed in 'grave' condition. The two remaining police shot at Thompson who dropped his hatchet then died at the scene. Innocent bystander: Police gather around a woman who was struck by an errant bullet discharged by a cop . Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said he's not ruling out terrorism especially in the wake of recent terror attacks in Canada, reports CNN. 'There is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case. I think certainly the heightened concern is relative to that type of assault based on what just happened in Canada,' said Bratton. CNN reports that Thompson has a criminal record in California and that he was discharged from the U.S. Navy for misconduct. Details of his criminal record and his misconduct are not known at this time. His Facebook page says that Thompson graduated from Columbia Teacher's College and that he resides in Queens. Praise: Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hold up a photo of the scene on Thursday and says that the group of recent Police Academy graduates handled the situation as best they could . CNN reports that New York police were alerted to be on the lookout for random attacks following Thursday's incident. DNA Info spoke with witnesses on the scene. 'We heard pop, pop, pop, pop,' said Rafael, 44, who works at Overseas Travel nearby where the incident occurred. 'She was screaming,\"'Help me.\" She couldn't get up,' said Ericka Babb, a medical assistant at Priority Medical Center in Queens. 'We were way too scared,' said Rafael. Officers say they shot the hatchet-yielding suspect but it’s not clear how many rounds were fired. 'It was a completely unprovoked attack,' said NYPD Chief Kim Royster, a department spokeswoman. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said during a news conference that all of the police involved are recent graduates of this summer's Police Academy class. 'Three rookie cops, absolutely modest about what happened today and what they did,' de Blasio said. During the conference Bill De Blasio lauded the officers' training and their fast response to the unprovoked attack.

{"id": 15101, "article": "An aspiring actress quit her job as a waitress on Monday after claiming a customer crossed the line and grabbed her butt, and now she's penned a biting account of the inappropriate incident. New York waitress Laura Ramadei made sure to jot down the name of the man she claims felt her up from the information on his credit card, and has identified him as hedge-fund manager Brian H Lederman. Lederman, a 57-year-old married man, has since hit back at Ramadei - saying he has 'grabbed plenty of girls' a**es' but not hers. In a long post on her Facebook page, Ramadei described the incident that happened this week while she was working a shift at SoHo restaurant Lucky Strike. Inappropriate: Aspiring actress Laura Ramadei (left) claims hedge-fund manager Brian Lederman (right) grabbed her butt while she was working a shift as a waitress at a New York restaurant this week . Family-friendly establishment: On Monday, Ramadei gave her two weeks notice at Lucky Strike, the SoHo restaurant where she worked . She says Lederman came into the family-friendly restaurant around 6:30pm with a friend a ordered Stoli vodka on the rocks. 'When I asked you and your companion if you'd be eating, or needing anything else from me, you put your hand - ever so gently - ON MY A** and asked if you could take me \"to go\". 'When I immediately stepped away and said \"Sorry, what?\" you probably gathered that I was and am not receptive of such advances from customers... 'I was wearing a loose-fitting, long sleeve shirt, jeans, and no makeup...so I'm not sure where the confusion arose as to what kind of service you were being provided,' Ramadei wrote. The waitress, who helps run an independent theater company, says she's worked as a bartender for five years since graduating with honors from NYU. During those years, she says she has been the victim of numerous inappropriate comments from customers but that it was this incident that inspired her to quit the service industry for good. 'I can't tell you how many times people have treated me horribly and I've memorized or photographed the names from their credit cards, fantasizing about internet revenge. But every time I've been tempted in the past (even after verbal attacks, physical affronts, or sexual harassment) I've stopped myself and let it go. 'So congratulations, Brian! You've done it! You broke this tired a** camel's back,' Ramadei wrote. She adds that while she is shaming him with the post, she didn't draft it as an attack. Money man: According to LinkedIn, Lederman is a hedge-fund manager for Swiss Performance Management and Fiduciary . 'Maybe - just maybe - via the intimately connected internet world, my post will reach you, and you'll learn something about how hurtful and upsetting a small comment or gesture might be,' she says. Not much: Lederman also only tipped $2 on his $15.24 bar tab . That post did read Lederman, but it doesn't seem to have moved him much. The infuriated finance worker spoke with the New York Post to deny he ever touched the waitress. 'I’ve grabbed plenty of girls’ a**es in my life,' Lederman said, 'But I’ve never grabbed hers.' While he admits making the comment about taking her 'to go' - he says it was a joke and he was only kidding. Now, Lederman vows Ramadei will never get a service-industry job again. 'That f****** c***, for her to do something like that is pretty ridiculous,' he said. 'I will make sure she doesn’t get another job in New York City. I know everybody: the bar owners, the club owners—that’s a terrible thing to write about somebody.' And to add insult to injury, Lederman only tipped the waitress $2 dollars on a $15.24 bar tab - a little less than 15 per cent which is considered the bare minimum for restaurants.", "reference": "Aspiring actress Laura Ramadei says hedge-fund manager Brian Lederman grabbed her butt while she was serving him at a restaurant recently .\nRamadei wrote a post on Facebook detailing the incident which made her quit her job .\nMarried Lederman saw the post and has since spoken out to say he never touched the waitress, though he admits to making a snide comment ."}

{"id": 15103, "article": "Tracey Sharp finally left the family farm she lived on with 'husband' Philip and his six 'wives' and now lives with her children in their own apartment . A mother who shared a man known as the ‘Rampant Rabbi’ with six other women has described their bizarre family life together – and explained why she finally walked out on him. Tracey Sharp, 46, claimed her ‘husband’ Philip, who has one legal wife, seven other ‘wives’ and 17 children, had ‘favourites’ and chose which woman shared his bed each night. She said he neglected her and forced her, like the rest of his women, to wear hats so that only he could see their hair. Finally she left, she claimed, because of his increasingly cold behaviour towards her. However, 53-year-old Mr Sharp, a self-proclaimed Rabbi, insisted yesterday that he told her to leave because she always insisted on being ‘top dog’ and was forever competing with the rest of his harem. Although the marriages are not legally binding, Mr Sharp, who never uses contraception, believes the women become his wives when they sleep with him. He claims to have received a message from God telling him he was a king from the Old Testament and should have many wives and children. Tracey met him in 1998 and ‘married’ him in 2001. She changed her surname to his by deed poll and went on to have two daughters with him – Naomi, nine, and Mischa, three. His other ‘wives’ also had ten children between them – on top of the five he had with his first wife – and all lived together on a farm in Whatlington, East Sussex. Although still legally separated from his legal wife Hadass, he now has six remaining ‘wives’ called Judith, Hannah, Vreni, Margo, Karyn and Chava, ranging in age from 29 to 68. The children are all home-schooled at the £675,000 farm, where the family exist on benefits of £1,500 a month, pensions and what they can make selling horses. Mr Sharp says he part-owns the property, which is up for sale, with two of his ‘wives’ and his mother-in-law. Togetherness: From left, Tracey, Judith Chava, Margo, Philip,Vreni Hannah and Karyn, with seven of the children they have had together . Rabbi Philip Sharp with wives (L-R) Margo, Tracey and Vreni and new daughters Shayna and Yanis . According to Tracey Sharp, after a . decade with her ‘husband’ his lack of attention and affection began to . get to her and she became ‘miserable, but still under his spell’. ‘We hardly had sex and he got on better with the other wives. He’d been a caring lover but, near the end, he was cold.’ Two years ago, she plucked up the courage to walk out on him. She is now training to be a physiotherapist and lives in Sussex. Mrs Sharp told Closer magazine that . she had made the right decision. ‘I was lonely for a long time after . leaving, but I’ll never regret it. I’m a lot happier. I love my . independence and feel stupid for getting into that set-up.’ By contrast, Mr Sharp said yesterday . that the whole family had asked Tracey to leave because her behaviour . had become intolerable. ‘Nobody could work with her because she was so . angry and nasty to people when she didn’t get what she wanted,’ he said. Three's no crowd: Philip Sharp with pregnant wives Vreni (left) and Margo . Tracey (second left) pictured with Philip (centre) and the other 'wives' (from left) Judith, Chava, Vreni,  Margo, Hannah and Karyn . The interview with Tracey Sharp can be read in this week's edition of Closer, which is available now . ‘It’s because she’s so dominant and so . competitive that all the problems started. She was one of my . favourites, but if she found I’d done something for one of my other . wives she would be furious and demand to know why I hadn’t done the same . for her. ‘We tried to help her to learn to live . with others, but in the end I said it’s best you get your own place and . learn these things yourself.’ He said that the separation was amicable . initially, but he was forced to go on the dole because his haulage . business was struggling and he faced the ‘desperate financial situation’ of supporting a large family. He said that Tracey became angry when . he could no longer pay her child support. ‘I’m not perfect, none of us . are, but I am not anything like the man she portrays me as. I’m not a . cult leader. I don’t keep people in chains. My wives and children who . live with me are happy and are here out of choice.’ Despite all the upheaval he remains . convinced that Tracey will return to the family. ‘There’s no book giving . advice on being married to several wives at the same time so you have . to work it out as you go along. ‘I’m still deeply in love with Tracey . and I believe she’s still in love with me. I do think we will be able to . work it out and eventually will all be back.’ Another of his ‘wives’, Vreni, claimed . that Tracey went on holiday with him a few months ago. ‘She acts like a . little child. I love her, but she has her moments when she gets angry . when she doesn’t get her own way. ‘I think she left because she couldn’t . be top dog and now she’s throwing dirt. She keeps coming back and then . something will happen and she’ll leave again.

Ayoze Perez’s strike for Newcastle United in the 1-0 win over Liverpool ensured this game’s ability to keep producing goals continues. These clubs have not shared a 0-0 draw since February 1974. It is all a far cry from behind-closed-doors practice matches against League Two opposition. Perez scored four in an 8-0 win that afternoon and his new team-mates are said to be quite taken with the Under-21 international, who had offers from Barcelona and Real Madrid before joining the Magpies in June. The intention, however, was to stagger his introduction to the senior set-up. Rather, his impact has been staggering. ‘There was a lot of interest in me from some very important teams, but I always knew that Newcastle would be the right move and the last few results have just proved that,’ he said. The former Tenerife striker holds his shirt and gestures with joy after scoring the winner on Saturday . Perez (left) and Newcastle team-mate Mehdi Abeid acknowledge the crowd following their fourth straight win . ‘I know I made the right decision and I am very happy here.’ He added: ‘I definitely feel ahead of schedule. I always hoped I could do well but things have been very good and I am feeling great here. I feel like I’m settling in well and I just can’t wait to play more games now because I feel like when I play I can score more goals.’ His headed winner at Spurs was followed by a predatory stab against Liverpool, seizing upon a mistake by compatriot Alberto Moreno to pierce Simon Mignolet’s target. And manager Alan Pardew feels Perez is a natural in the penalty box. ‘He has a knack,’ said the United boss, whose own position is now safe on the back of four straight wins. ‘He has a lot to learn about the English Premier League but you know that if something falls for him he will score. You sometimes get a player who can do it in training but not on matchday, but he has shown he can do that and has had a fabulous week.’ From YouTube to Match of the Day, the rookie striker is certainly passing his Premier League screen test.

Arrested: Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, faces charges for the murder of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the Allen family home . The son of a former aide to President George W. Bush has been charged with murdering a man with a hatchet at his home. Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, was arrested on Friday by police after they found the body of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the Allen family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Records show that the home is owned by Allen's father, Claude A. Allen, a former Bush domestic policy adviser who pleaded guilty to theft in 2006. The student called 911 around midnight and told police that he killed an intruder after he tried to break in. But authorities determined it wasn't a break-in and that the younger Allen knew Harvey. Harvey's body was found around 75 yards behind the house but police told the Washington Post that they believe an altercation occurred and the attack started in a two-car garage. Montgomery County Police Capt. Jim Daly told the Post it was not clear if the argument moved to the woods or if the man's . body was dragged there after he died. When . police arrived at the large white-brick home, Allen was waiting for . them but that his parents were not home at the time of the attack. They . found the hatchet in a garbage can. Crime scene: Investigators gather outside the Maryland property where a man was killed with a hatchet . Another man had been there, but left by the time police arrived. They tracked him down and questioned him but he is not a suspect, Daly told the Post. A lawyer who represented the younger Allen in a marijuana case declined comment. A neighbor told the Post that Allen, a star soccer and rugby player, had just returned home from college in the state. It is not the family's first brush with the law; Claude Alexander Allen, now 52, was arrested in 2006 for allegedly claiming refunds for more than $5,000 worth of merchandise he did not buy. Connections: George W. Bush is pictured with deputy chief of staff Karl Rove (center) and domestic policy adviser Claude Allen (right), in July 2005. Allen's son has now been arrested for murder . Legal issues: The alleged murderer's father (seen left of then-President Bush in 2005) left the administration when he was caught shoplifting $5,000-worth of merchandise . The thefts occurred at 25 stores from 2005 until 2006 even though his annual salary as an adviser was $160,000 . 'I was shocked and my first reaction was one of disappointment, deep disappointment - if it's true - that we were not fully informed,' Bush said at the time. Allen pleaded guilty to theft on August 4, 2006. He claimed that in the months leading up to the thefts, he had suffered huge stress and sleep deprivation. His wife cited Hurricane Katrina and his subsequent work as one of the causes of stress. Allen was ordered to reimburse Target for the $850 of stolen merchandise. He also paid a $500 fine and agreed to perform 40 hours of community service. Disgraced: Allen Sr., pictured left with his wife Jannese as he leaves court and right in his mugshot, stepped down from the role working for Bush in 2005 after he was caught shoplifting . A trained lawyer, he was a deputy secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services and nominated to a federal appeals court seat in 2003. He joined the White House during Bush's second term but abruptly resigned from the role shortly after being charged with misdemeanor theft. In September 2011, the D.C.

{"id": 15108, "article": "(CNN) -- Brian Sanderholm thinks Justin Thurber deserves to die for raping and killing his 19-year-old daughter. A Kansas jury sentenced Jodi Sanderholm's killer, Justin Thurber, to death in February. \"I believe in an eye for an eye. If you do the crime, you need to have justice,\" he said. \"In the end, it's up to the jury, but all that matters is that he can't hurt anyone again.\" But amid a time of economic turmoil some legislators in Kansas and elsewhere say the price of justice is too high. They have introduced legislation to take the death penalty off the books over financial concerns. Jodi Sanderholm was last seen alive on January 5, 2007, at dance practice at Cowley College in Arkansas City, Kansas, where she was a student and member of the Cowley College Tigerettes Danceline. Her bruised and battered body was found four days later in a pile of brush, bearing signs of a violent and prolonged death that prosecutors likened to torture. A jury sentenced Thurber to death on February 18. A Kansas court will decide whether to uphold the jury's verdict in a hearing scheduled for March 20. If Kansas Senate Bill 208 passes as written, it won't take effect until July 1, so it is unlikely to affect Thurber's sentence. But future savings could be substantial. \"Because of the downturn in the national economy, we are facing one of the largest budget deficits in our history,\" state Sen. Carolyn McGinn, a Republican, said in an opinion piece posted on TheKansan.com Friday. \"What is certain is we are all going to have to look at new and creative ways to fund state and community programs and services.\" The state would save more than $500,000 per case by not seeking the death penalty, McGinn wrote, money that could be used for \"prevention programs, community corrections and other programs to decrease future crimes against society.\" Fiscal concerns are just a part of McGinn's argument. She has also cited the disproportionate rate of minorities that are sentenced to death. Kansas reintroduced the death penalty in 1994 but has not executed a condemned inmate since 1965. Anti-death-penalty groups say longer jury selection, extra expert witnesses, jury consultants and an extended penalty phase tend to make death penalty trials more costly than non-death-penalty cases. Extra safeguards in place to ensure a fair verdict, including additional investigators and defense attorneys certified to handle death cases, who spend more time researching and litigating the case, also drive up costs.  See a chart comparing the costs of two murder trials » . A 2008 study by the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy research group based in Maryland, found that an average capital murder trial in the state resulting in a death sentence costs about $3 million, or $1.9 million more than a case where the death penalty is not sought. A similar 2008 study by the ACLU in Northern California found that a death- penalty trial costs about $1.1 million more than a non-death-penalty trial in California. McGinn's bill faces opposition from various sides, including victims' rights groups and the state's top prosecutor, who says there are no hard numbers related to the cost of the death penalty. New Mexico, which also has a bill before the Legislature to abolish the death penalty, has already seen a case where costs dictated the outcome.  See which states have bills to get rid of the death penalty » . Last year, the New Mexico attorney general's office agreed to drop the death penalty for two inmates involved in the stabbing death of a guard, Ralph Garcia, during a 1999 riot at the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility. The change came after the state Legislature failed to provide additional funding for defense attorneys contracted to handle the case by the public defender's office. In court documents filed at the time, Attorney General Gary King said his office could not \"in good faith under these circumstances\" pursue the death penalty against Robert Young and Reis Lopez. Even Garcia's wife lent her voice to the case, writing a letter to then-Assistant Attorney General Michael Fox explaining why she did not support the death penalty. \"I would rather see the death penalty be abolished and reparation be made to the victims, wives or husbands and to their children. I know how hard it is to go look for a job when my job was staying home and taking care of the home and kids and my husband was the breadwinner,\" Rachel Garcia wrote in a letter dated February 28, 2005. \"My husband would [have] wanted something like this as much as I do because he so much loved his family.\" Her sentiments became part a bill to abolish the death penalty that was introduced in 2007 and died on the Senate floor in New Mexico. Its supporters are hopeful it has a better chance this year -- so far, it has passed the House of Representatives and is awaiting action in the Senate. \"I think it helps the debate from being less emotional than it has the potential to be,\" Democratic Rep. Gail Chasey said. \"People will say we can't put a price on justice, but in fact, we do put a price on justice when we are not able to give our district attorneys, our police departments, our attorney general the funding they need.\" In Colorado, House Bill 1274 proposes to put the anticipated savings from abolishing the death penalty toward the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's cold case homicide team. Guy Morton's family thought he was missing for 12 years until they learned his remains had been misidentified. The state has about 1,430 unsolved homicides dating back to 1970, according to Howard Morton, founder of the Families of Homicide Victims and Missing Persons, an advocacy group pushing for the bill. For Morton, whose son, Guy, disappeared in 1975, the issue goes beyond the misuse of tax dollars. Guy was considered a missing person for 12 years until forensic examination revealed that his remains had been misidentified. His killer was never found. \"As bad as it is to think that our son's killer is still on the streets or in our neighborhoods, there's nothing worse than feeling like he's been forgotten, just another file in a basement,\" he said. \"Once you've had a loved one murdered, there can be no closure, but there can be resolution, the feeling like, oh well, at least justice was done.\" Kansas, New Mexico and Colorado, among the states where legislators are seeking to get rid of the death penalty, have carried out few or no executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. On the other hand, Texas, Georgia and Virginia, which consistently lead the nation in executions each year, show no signs of changing course. Earlier this month, Virginia legislators voted to expand capital punishment to include those who assist in a murder, and those who kill an auxiliary police officer or on-duty fire marshal. A bill to abolish the death penalty is also before the Texas legislature, but Harris County District Attorney Pat Lykos intends to proceed with 194 pending death penalty cases she has on the books. \"We will spare no expense. We will go after them. Justice has no price tag,\" Lykos said. \"We want to be as cost-effective as possible without compromising the administration of justice and public safety.\" Nonetheless, budget concerns in those states still hamper some efforts to seek the death penalty. In Georgia, where Gov. Sonny Perdue has ordered all government agencies to trim their budgets by 6 percent, Jamie Ryan Weis, on trial for murder, has been sitting in a jail without a lawyer for more than a year. The Georgia Public Defender Standards Council appointed two private attorneys in 2006 to represent Weis, who is charged with the murder of Catherine King. They were pulled from the case a year later because of a lack of funds, court documents indicate, and the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council has yet to replace them. \"The state basically says we want to have the death penalty and we don't want to pay for it. It's like the state says it's going to the grocery store to buy the most expensive food and it's not going to pay for it,\" said attorney Don Samuel, one of three attorneys attempting to obtain a lawyer for Weis. Griffin Judicial Circuit District Attorney Scott Ballard said he plans to seek the death penalty against Weis, no matter how long it takes or how much it costs. \"I think that if you start deciding it's too expensive to pursue the death penalty, then you're encouraging the defense to make it too expensive, and our duty to the public is too great to succumb to that,\" Ballard said. Back in Kansas, Brian Sanderholm says the state has a duty to victims, too. He opposes efforts to abolish the death penalty because he says families should be able to weigh in on an appropriate punishment, and juries should render the final outcome. In fact, if Thurber had admitted sooner to having killed his daughter, the father says he would have accepted a life sentence for him. But by the time Thurber decided to admit his role and seek a plea deal with prosecutors, his family had already been through too much, Sanderholm says. \"It was too late,\" Sanderholm said. \"We'd struggled so much, but after struggling for two years, we decided we're just going to go on with it.\" CNN's Brett Roegiers contributed to this report.", "reference": "At least nine states have bills seeking to abolish or repeal the death penalty .\nElsewhere, state budget cuts are delaying or halting death penalty trials .\nColorado bill seeks to use capital case funds for cold case investigations .\nHarris County, Texas, DA Pat Lykos vows to continue seeking death penalty ."}

Manson was jailed for five years in 2003 after attempting a similar £17million fraud. A lawyer who posed as a wealthy investor to con two venture capitalists out of £250,000 has been jailed for six years. Gordon Manson, 48, from Edinburgh, used the cash in an attempt to negotiate the takeover of a business worth £19million. His scam was only foiled when the owner of the company mentioned the deal to a friend over drinks and was told Manson was a conman. Jailing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, told Manson: 'Your whole lifestyle has been self-centred and based on dishonesty and self-delusion.' He added: 'You gave every appearance that your . interest in that company was genuine, using professional advisers. 'Subsequently your true identity was discovered and you were arrested. ‘You were financing these activities . on the back of two loans from venture finance companies. This was . fraudulent from the outset and professionally planned.’ The Old Bailey heard Manson first made an approach to invest in Avanta, a serviced office company, in late 2010. Posing as Fraser Henderson, he claimed he was ‘cash rich’ with a portfolio of serviced offices outside London. In May 2012 he made another approach . to buy the business and met with the owner David Alberto at the Westbury . Hotel in Mayfair to discuss the deal. Manson claimed he ran a property . investment business and spent most of his time in Andorra and Madrid. He . also claimed that he had access to a £50million fund to invest, although prosecutor Antony Swift said there is not believed to be any truth to the claims. Mr Alberto spent £80,000 in professional fees relating to the deal before learning ‘Henderson’ was in fact a conman named Gordon Manson. In 2003, Manson, a qualified solicitor, was jailed for five years in 2003 after attempting a similar £17million fraud in Edinburgh. After the discovery, Mr Alberto contacted police and then arranged a meeting with Manson at an office in London so the fraudster could be arrested. Old Bailey Judge Brian Barker said Manson based his life on 'dishonesty and self-delusion' as he jailed him for six years . Manson later admitted that he had obtained loans worth £250,000 in order to finance the acquisition of Avanta, including £100,000 from Jeremy Keith and £150,000 from Zafir Rafiq. Both loans were backed by personal guarantees which had been falsified by Manson. Mr Swift said: ‘He used false documentation about his own financial worth and false accounts, all giving the impression he was a man of substance when he was in fact a man of straw. ‘His explanation was the deal could have worked and nobody would have lost anything. The Crown say that is simply untrue. ‘Clearly when a fraudster like the defendant is looking to buy a company like Avanta the risk is once he gets his foot in the door he will use its good standing in order to fleece them and line his pockets.’ Defence barrister Wayne Cleaver said all of the money had been spent on surveyors, lawyers and ‘other expenses’ and there was nothing left. Manson pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud by false representation. The judge sentenced him to 32 months for the Avanta fraud. He was also sentenced for 40 months for each of the bridging loan frauds to be served concurrently.", "reference": "Gordon Manson scammed fortune before trying to takeover £19m business .\nHis life was based on 'dishonesty and self-delusion' according to Old Bailey judge .\nJailed for six years ."}

Actor Michael Shannon (left) says that e-cigarettes are ideal props for amoral villains. The Tourist, starring Johnny Depp, was one of the first films to show the devices (pictured) Shannon, who stars as a corrupt estate agent in 99 Homes, said that his e-cigarette was a crucial part of his character, in an interview with The Times. The prop was suggested by Ramin Bahrani, the film’s director, who believes that e-cigarettes may come to denote characters who are too slick and charming to be trustworthy. 'Ramin gave me one e-cigarette and I started tooting on it like…I can’t think of a good metaphor,’ said Shannon, who starred in Revolutionary Road. ‘I couldn’t stop fiddling with it. It was always in my hand.‘ . ‘It’s like one of those old cartoons with the steam blowing out of the smokestack, and that’s what Caver is like – this smokestack that’s about to blow all the time.’ He said that it came in most useful when his character was trying to evict a desperate man, who responds by threatening to shoot his family and himself.

Other directors are going to copy it.’ The Tourist, starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, was one of the first films to feature electronic cigarettes. Depp is  seen using the device on a train, when questioned why he is smoking in public place, which is obviously banned, he explains how electronic cigarettes are exempt from the public smoking ban. Traditional cigarettes denoted glamour and empowerment for female stars like Marlene Dietrich and Bette Davis. And Audrey Hepburn’s cigarette holder in breakfast in Tiffany’s became a character-defining prop. Smoking enhanced Marlon Brando’s sex appeal in A Streetcar Named Desire and signified rebellion for James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause.

(Stock picture) Britons are being told by the health watchdog not to offer sweet treats to friends and family who are trying to lose weight. They are also being instructed not to invite colleagues who are attempting to cut back on alcohol to go the pub after work. The watchdog, NICE, says it is neither ‘helpful’ nor ‘a joke’ to deliberately try to tempt those who are desperately trying to stick to resolutions to become healthier. Guidelines issued by the organisation today also urge doctors, nurses and midwives to question patients about their lifestyles when they arrive in A&E, have a routine appointment or scan, or come in to pick up a prescription. Staff should use ‘every opportunity’ to help patients change unhealthy habits. They are told not to be too ‘embarrassed’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet, or would consider doing do so. And if they suspect someone has a drink problem, they are encouraged to ask them questions designed to assess their alcohol intake. The guidelines – published when millions have made New Year’s resolutions to tackle their weight or drinking – are intended to help health staff and the general public tackle the rising problem of obesity and excessive drinking. Employers are told to consider banning staff from smoking throughout the working day and to ensure they motivate staff who are trying to lead healthier lives. The advice also reminds local councils they have the power to ban pubs from opening in areas where there are already a high number of licensed premises. But critics have accused NICE of ‘nannying’ and say the last thing adults need is to be ‘lectured’ on healthy living by their own friends and family. Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘This is subversive nannying from a health quango that puts out this kind of drivel in a desperate attempt to justify its continued and costly existence. ‘Many of us will be trying to shed a few extra pounds or cut back on the booze over the new year, but we don’t need quangocrats lecturing our friends and colleagues while we do so. This is further evidence that NICE is both a waste of everybody’s time and taxpayers’ money.’ With more than a quarter of Britons now obese, the guidelines urge medics not to be too ‘embarrassed’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet, or would consider doing do so . But Professor Mike Kelly, director of the centre of public health at NICE, said: ‘The idea is quite simple. First of all you should share your goals with friends, family and work colleagues so they understand what you’re trying to do. ‘They also must understand it’s not helpful or a joke to tempt people deliberately. Some do – it’s a bit of fun. They go on a diet, and someone says, “Oh come on this cream cake won’t do any harm”.’ ‘Say for example someone says, “I’m going to make a real effort to cut down on my drinking.” If the first thing that happens within the next five minutes is that a colleague says, “Come on, we’re all going down the pub after work”, that doesn’t help. ‘It’s asking people to be a bit more thoughtful, a bit more understanding of the difficulties. When people fall off their best intentions, they can’t keep on the diet, that’s where friends, family and so on can help. ‘It’s a bit of encouragement and it’s a way of sharing the task rather than people trying to do it on their own. It’s based on very sound psychological principles which acknowledge that our ambitions often outstrip our human capacity to do things. ‘It’s that nudge in the right direction that can keep people on track.’ Just over a quarter of adults in Britain are now obese while nearly half of men and a third of women drink too much alcohol. NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, says Britons have done very well in recent years to cut down on smoking, but obesity and excessive drinking remain huge public health concerns. The watchdog is also in charge of deciding which new drugs should be available on the NHS and it has been criticised in the past for rejecting life-extending cancer drugs. Last year not one of the 11 new drugs made available was approved. Some of its other health guidance has been deemed controversial. Last year it suggested councils should raise parking charges to encourage the public to walk.", "reference": "NICE tells Britons it's not 'a joke' to deliberately tempt those trying to slim .\nNew guidelines also urge medics to question patients about their lifestyles .\nStaff told not to be 'embarrassed' to ask overweight patients about dieting .\nBut critics call the advice 'subversive nannying from a health quango'"}
{"id": 15114, "article": "(CNN) -- What's Spanish for \"twerk?\" Mexican officials are in no hurry to find out. This is one U.S. import our southern neighbor wants nothing to do with. Ditto for Miley Cyrus, the controversial singer known less for her music than for her over-sexualized on-stage spectacles intended to get attention and shock the senses. Cyrus accomplished both on the Diez y Seis de Septiembre -- better known, on this side of the border, as September 16th. North of the Rio Grande, that day is like any other, as insignificant as the Fourth of July is in Canada. However, in Mexico, the day is awfully important. It's Independence Day. And since Mexicans are a proud people who put a high value on respect, it's probably not a good idea for Americans -- or anyone else for that matter -- to go to Mexico on Mexican Independence Day and show disrespect to, oh, the Mexican flag. That's what Cyrus and fellow performers did last week during a concert in the northern city of Monterrey in a stunt that gives new meaning to the phrase \"ugly Americans.\" As Cyrus \"twerked\" onstage, while wearing -- yes, you read this right -- a giant prosthetic butt, her backup singers whipped her with rolled up pieces of cloth that turned out to be miniature Mexican flags. It was a trifecta of bad judgment -- the wrong thing to do, the wrong country to do it in, and all of it happening on the wrong day. Before you could say international incident, outraged Mexican state legislators asked the federal government to fine the pop star for desecrating the Mexican flag. Under a law that prohibits abuse of \"national emblems, the flag and the national anthem,\" such a transgression can normally earn someone a $1,270 fine as well as, in some cases, a couple of days in jail. The legislators are asking that Cyrus get locked up for 36 hours. Mexican authorities are investigating. There are those in this country who will claim that the singer is being singled out because she is an American. But actually, in this case, equal treatment would call out for some sort of punishment. It's a good time to send a message. In 2008, Mexican pop star Paulina Rubio was fined $4,000 for appearing in a Spanish magazine, clutching a Mexican flag wrapped around her naked body. What the 21-year-old Cyrus and her crew did was tasteless and thoughtless. And whether or not Mexican officials decide to formally charge her with desecrating the Mexican flag, she ought to apologize -- in person, and on Mexican soil. Having said that, Mexican officials need to be careful not to overplay their hand and protest too much, lest they turn legitimate concerns about professional decorum in the entertainment industry into dinner theater. The initial response was not encouraging. Speaking to CNN, Mexican State Rep. Francisco TreviÃ±o said this: \"I am truly offended and annoyed by the fact that a foreign artist feels like she can come here and make fun of and mock our national flag on Independence Day, September 16th.\" Seriously? Trevino can't really believe that the stunt was intended as a direct assault on the Mexican flag. An assault on decency and good manners, maybe. Does he think this was some sort of political statement? He is probably giving Cyrus and her backup dancers too much credit. Finally, is this really an attempt to mock the flag? The dancers used it as a prop, but the idea was clearly to draw attention to Cyrus -- not the flag. As a Mexican-American, I realize that, in Mexico, my grandfather's homeland, the second-most popular sport -- after soccer -- is American bashing. And Cyrus played right into the hands of our neighbors by giving them a weapon to wield against us. But Mexicans don't always have to play that game. Let's hope that they treat this for what it is -- an isolated incident by an immature and attention starved pop singer. Nothing more. The U.S.-Mexico relationship is strong. It has suffered through war, conquest, revolution, migration, xenophobia, gun running, drugs, protectionism, Manifest Destiny, income disparity and more. It can suffer fools.", "reference": "Ruben Navarrette: Miley Cyrus concert in Monterrey, Mexico made tasteless use of Mexican flag .\nNavarrette: What made it particularly egregious was that it came on Mexican independence day .\nHe says Cyrus should apologize and could be fined but don't make it an international incident ."}
{"id": 15115, "article": "By . Anna Edwards . The former Youth Police and Crime Commissioner Paris Brown has been interviewed under caution . Paris Brown,the foul-mouthed youth crime commissioner who was forced to quit after her string of offensive Tweets, has been interviewed under caution about her comments. The 17-year-old's mobile phone was seized and she was questioned by officers from Kent police's Special Branch. Her lawyers described Kent Police’s response as 'wholly disproportionate' and claimed it was 'inconceivable' that her comments would be sufficient grounds for prosecution. Olswang Solicitors accused Kent Police overreacting and accused them of having no proper basis for interviewing the teenager under caution, or making her surrender her phone, The Times reported. Police started investigating 17-year-old former Youth Police and Crime Commissioner Paris Brown after discovering she used a racial slur in her Twitter profile. Miss Brown resigned after it was revealed that she used her personal Twitter account to make a series of offensive, racist and homophobic posts. Kent Police are understood to be looking at tweets where Miss Brown uses the word 'n*****' – an offensive term for black people – in alternative spellings. The force also confirmed it has received more than 50 complaints but is yet to decide whether Miss Brown has committed any offence. Scroll down for video . Ann Barnes, Kent Police and Crime Commissioner, left, with Paris Brown, before the teenager's offensive rants were investigated . Her account, where she posted or . circulated more than 4,000 messages, was deleted last Saturday after . this newspaper asked her to explain messages referring to drug use, . underage drinking and threats of violence. Miss Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force 'stay in touch with young people'. She called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers 'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men', an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school. In another tweet, seemingly referring to cannabis, she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.' And she attacked the men in the reality TV programme Made In Chelsea, writing: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag.' Paris Brown's lawyers have written to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth about the scope and nature of the investigation . Today it emerged that Paris's lawyers, Olswang, have written to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth about the scope and nature of the investigation, including the decision to seize her phone and for Special Branch to quiz her. In the letter, her lawyers said: 'That appears to be wholly disproportionate and unjustified having regard to the Twitter material itself and the broader circumstances of the case.' They said Paris, from Sheerness, Kent, was visited by a Special Branch officer at her home on April 11, along with a second officer, and asked to surrender her mobile for examination. Then she was requested to attend an interview under caution on April 14. She was quizzed for one hour and seven minutes about material posted on her Twitter account which had already been published in the media. Her phone was returned three days later. In their letter, her lawyers said: 'As we are sure that you will readily understand, being subject to a police investigation is highly distressing for any person, but especially so for a teenager, particularly one who has been recently subject to such adverse media coverage. 'In such circumstances, we believe that the police must weigh carefully the extent to which an investigation relating solely to social media activity is merited.' Olswang also referred to the interim guidelines from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer, regarding prosecutions relating to social media. Paris's lawyers said it was 'immediately apparent' from reviewing the Twitter material that it would be 'inconceivable' that they would form sufficient grounds for a prosecution. 'There is nothing in the Twitter material which could be deemed, even on its face, to be grossly offensive or otherwise unlawful,' the letter added. 'There was therefore no proper basis on which to require our 17-year-old client to surrender her mobile telephone, to caution her or to subject her to a detailed police interview whilst under caution.' But Kent Police have defended their actions, saying they are reacting to complaints from members of the public and are seeking to establish whether any offences have been committed. 'Kent Police received more than 50 complaints from members of the public and are currently investigating to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed in relation to this incident. 'Kent Police disagrees with the interpretation of the investigation given. 'Officers must first determine the extent of the misuse of social media so that the Crown Prosecution Service can then, taking into account the DPP's interim guidance, determine whether or not any potential evidence meets the set criteria for a prosecution. 'We will investigate all complaints thoroughly but cannot comment further on the progress of a live investigation.'

Love triangle: Singer Bryan Adams fathered a child with his PA Alicia Grimaldi but failed to tell his love Antonia Harrison . When it comes to expressing romantic regret in epic love songs, Bryan Adams is considered something of a master. Now the Canadian rocker may need all his songwriting skills after apparently failing to inform his lover he was expecting a child with his personal assistant. Adams has denied even being in a long-term relationship with glamorous advertising executive Antonia Harrison, 36. But she says they had been dating each other for two years and that Adams has still not told her the truth about Cambridge-educated Alicia Grimaldi’s pregnancy. Antonia refused to see the singer, who is best known for his hit ballad (Everything I Do) I Do It For You, on learning about the baby. But friends say he has tried to get back in touch with Antonia and they believe he wanted to see her again. A friend of Antonia’s revealed: ‘Bryan has never confirmed to Antonia that the child is even his but we can only assume so. He has still never answered a direct question on it. Lots of people believe he would have preferred never to tell the public about the baby. ‘Maybe Bryan would have liked to continue seeing Antonia and looking after Alicia and the baby. ‘But he didn’t have any choice when it came to Antonia – she refused to see him again after hearing the news. ‘They did tentatively speak as friends on many occasions. I believe Antonia had a thought in her mind that it could all go back to normal.’ Last week, 51-year-old Adams was pictured outside his £2.4 million London home with his first child, three-month-old Mirabella Bunny, who was born on Good Friday. The baby has come as a shock to Antonia, who began seeing Adams at the start of 2009.The friend said: ‘Antonia had kept their relationship to herself for a few months. She smiled a lot around that time – a lot.’ Alicia Grimaldi (left) carrying her and the singer's baby Mirabella Bunny and Adams' current girlfriend Antonia Harrison . Adams would call Antonia whenever he was in London and arrange to meet. ‘He is a very, very busy man and obsessive about not stopping for one minute. For a clean-living man, that is his addiction. He travels perhaps two weeks out of every four. Antonia saw him when he was in Britain. ‘He made her glow. Even though she didn’t like to talk about him, you could tell that she was very happy. She is a passionate character so the relationship was obviously very passionate. ‘They would talk about photography, fashion, music and film. They’re both into anything cultural. Antonia studied history at university and reads everything and anything. ‘She likes to learn from people and found his knowledge of world topics a very attractive aspect of his personality. ‘They also found each other very physically attractive.’ Antonia also has a high-powered job as deputy general manager of the luxury atelier division of creative ad agency Leo Burnett and was happy to accept the erratic nature of their relationship. The friend said: ‘I believe that there was a “we live for today” attitude between them. But he never gave off any signs of wanting to settle down and Antonia’s not a jealous person anyway.’ The couple were seen at upmarket restaurants where teetotal and strict vegan Bryan would nurse a hot water with lemon. Sometimes he would sing to her. Crooner: Adams is best known for his ballad (Everything I Do ) I Do It For You, which spent an astonishing 16 weeks at number one in the charts . ‘I think when they were together it was their time – hiding away from the world in his place. It was all very romantic, I suppose.’ Bryan was forever welcoming guests into his many homes, and troubled actress Lindsay Lohan once stayed for three weeks with girlfriend Sam Ronson. Late singer Amy Winehouse also stayed at his house on the Caribbean island of Mustique, which she ‘hated – he only had beetroot and carrot juice in the fridge’. Despite this generosity, Antonia’s friend said: ‘When he is busy then love life comes second. I know an ex-girlfriend of his from way back and she said he was very selfish and everything was only on his terms.’ In October, Antonia was invited . to spend time with Adams after his concert in Manchester, and the couple spent the night together in the city’s Lowry Hotel. But by this time Alicia was already pregnant. Alicia, 31, who is the daughter of the Isle of Wight’s deputy lieutenant Peter Grimaldi, met Adams in 2004 while helping to set up his Bryan Adams Foundation, which provides grants to support vulnerable people. Mr Adams’ spokesman Gary Farrow last night dismissed the friend’s comments and added: ‘It’s all been done before.’", "reference": "Friends tell how Canadian rocker went on dating glamorous British woman despite making his secretary pregnant ."}
{"id": 15117, "article": "(CNN) -- A hair stylist is accusing former \"American Idol\" judge and rapper Nicki Minaj of wigging out on a deal. Terrence Davidson filed suit Friday in district court in Atlanta alleging that the star not only stole his wig designs, but also cost him a potential reality show deal that he was discouraged from pursuing. According to the complaint, Davidson started working for Minaj -- whose real name is Onika Maraj -- as her hair stylist in January 2010. He says he began making wigs for her which she would then select for her appearances. At the time Minaj was a burgeoning star who had steadily built her fan base by appearing as a guest rapper on mix tapes and projects by her label mates at Young Money Entertainment. She quickly became known as the first lady of Young Money, which includes superstar rappers Drake and Lil Wayne. The female rapper also became well known for her sense of style, including a multitude of wigs ranging from platinum blonde to pink. She poses in an ensemble which includes a pink wig on the cover of her platinum-selling debut album \"Pink Friday,\" released in November 2010. Both Davidson and his attorney, Christopher Chestnut, talked to CNN about his influence on crafting Minaj's image as well as the fact that the rapper now sells wigs on her site based on the designs Davidson says he created. The stylist said he discovered the wigs were being marketed and sold after someone sent him a picture and he began researching. \"I see these wigs online,\" said Davidson, who has also worked with others in the industry, including singer Patti LaBelle and rapper Remy Ma. \"People are basically duplicating what I created for Nicki Minaj.\" \"Nicki Minaj is reaping great success and financial bounty reward for Terrence's creative expertise, and he is entitled to participate in that,\" Chestnut said. \"Someone's got to stand up for the artist. We applaud the fact that she's making millions, but she's also got to pay bounty to those whose creative designs she's making millions off of.\" In his suit, Davidson says he designed several wigs for Minaj, including the \"Pink Upper Bun Wig,\" the \"Fox Fur Wig,\" and the \"Half Blonde-Half Pink Wig\" that she wore in appearances, including the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards preshow. He says there were plans for he and Minaj to launch a wig line and discussions about a possible reality show. But by 2012, the suit claims, \"Minaj and her agents became mum about the business ventures and took active steps to isolate Mr. Davidson and preclude him from the notoriety he deserved for his wig designs.\" \"On its face you might think, what this guy is suing over wigs,\" Davidson's attorney Chestnut said. \"But we really have to consider this in context. Hair is a multibillion-dollar industry, but moreover these are not your grandma's wigs. These are eclectic. They are decadent, and they are creative. This is about a brand that Terrence has built.\" CNN has reached out to Minaj and her representatives for comment.", "reference": "A hair stylist is claiming Minaj stole his wig designs .\nTerrence Davidson began working with the rapper in 2010 .\nMinaj now sells wigs on her website ."}
{"id": 15118, "article": "By . Sophie Borland . Professor Bruce Keogh's review is also expected to suggest that the number of A&E departments should not be reduced and in some cases may need to be made bigger . Paramedics will be urged to drop patients off at their GP or high street chemist rather than taking them to casualty, under NHS guidelines. Officials also want ambulance staff to treat less seriously-ill patients in their own homes and only bring them to hospital if necessary. This week the NHS’s medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will publish a major report setting out what needs to be improved in A&E units to avert a crisis this winter. Many departments are already struggling to cope with the combination of a steady rise in patients and drastic shortages of senior doctors. The numbers of patients turning up in A&E has soared by a third in the past decade, which has partly been blamed on a failure of GP out-of-hours services and an ageing population. At the same time, fewer doctors are wanting to specialise in ‘emergency’ medicine as it involves working out-of-hours. Senior doctors fear this winter may be one of the busiest yet with the numbers of patients rising further with the onset of the norovirus and flu. The report, to be published on Wednesday, is likely to urge paramedics to be more involved in diagnosing and treating patients rather than just ferrying them to hospital. Outlining his plans earlier this autumn, Sir Bruce said: ‘Historically ambulances have been about transporting people from one place to another. ‘Increasingly we’ve seen ambulances treating people in their own home, delivering clot-busting drugs, treating severe asthma, treating heart attacks and delivering the early stages of stroke treatment. ‘There is more that ambulances services and others can do in providing early treatment.’ He added ambulances could also be used to drop patients off at GP surgeries if they weren’t found to be seriously ill, at a chemist or at home. The report may also suggest A&E units start specialising in treating certain conditions or injuries – such as heart attacks and stroke or traffic accidents. An NHS report due to be published this week is expected to advise paramedics not to take as many patients to A&E . Officials believe that although patients would have to travel further to reach the most appropriate centre, they would receive a higher standard of treatment. Experts also expect the NHS will eventually have to reduce the number of A&Es in England to save money although this is unlikely to be announced this week. Only last week the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, urged patients to stockpile medicines and call NHS 111 rather than going to casualty. Dr Bernadette Garrihy, a senior member of the College and consultant at Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital, said: ‘We are getting ready for what may be our worst winter yet. ‘This, in the face of rising demand, is a real issue for us. We are concerned about providing a safe and quality service this winter. ‘People should look after themselves this winter. They should keep simple remedies in the house, they should try to talk to their GP if they can, they should use the 111 service and then only as a last resort, if any of these fail, access the emergency departments.’", "reference": "Professor Bruce Keogh's review suggests taking most patients to hospitals does not always offer the best care .\nThe report will also say that in some cases A&E departments should not be reduced but expanded ."}

Apple and Samsung are the world's two biggest smartphone makers. The bitter rivals have been waging a global battle for supremacy of the $300 billion worldwide market. Apple has argued in courts, government tribunals and regulatory agencies around the world that Samsung's Android-based phones copy vital iPhone features. Samsung is fighting back with its own complaints that some key Apple patents are invalid and Apple has copied Samsung's technology.

'Apple can never get back to where it should have been in 2010,' Lee told the jury on Tuesday at the conclusion of the week-long trial. The fight in San Jose is particularly contentious. The courtroom is a 15-minute drive from Apple's Cupertino headquarters, and several prospective jurors were dismissed because of their ties to the company. The South Korean-based Samsung has twice sought to stop the trial, accusing Apple on Tuesday of unfairly trying to inflame patriotic passions by urging jurors to help protect American companies from overseas competitors. The judge denied Samsung's request for a mistrial, but did reread to reread an instruction ordering them to put aside their dislikes and biases in deciding the case.

{"id": 15121, "article": "Andy Murray powered through to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon yesterday – but he wasn’t always the centre of attention. Many spectators found themselves distracted by the sartorial choices of Ilie Nastase and Sir Cliff Richard. Nastase, the 67-year-old Romanian former world number one, was described as looking like a South American dictator from the 1970s as he arrived in the royal box in a blue military-style jacket and dark glasses. Military parade: Former 1970s tennis ace Ilie Nastase arrived in the Royal Box of Centre Court wearing a strange blue military-style outfit and dark glasses . 'Bucharest Buffoon': Mr Nastase is believed to have been wearing his authentic Romanian military uniform to Wimbledon on Monday . As dashing as ever: In his heyday, the four-times married tennis star was reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women . During his volatile playing career the . man nicknamed ‘the Bucharest Buffoon’ was officially a Romanian army . officer and was employed by the ministry of defence under his country’s . communist regime. Communism was overthrown in 1989 and Nastase later said his military rank had been merely honorary. In . 2008, he was named retired major-general by Romanian presidential . decree, and he is believed to have been proudly wearing his formal . uniform at Wimbledon yesterday. Twice . a Wimbledon losing finalist in the Seventies, Nastase was known as much . for his on-court histrionics as his playing ability. Sir Cliff the Sartorial: Sir Cliff Richard turned heads in a garish blue striped suit with a mismatching tie . Making an effort: Despite the obvious fashion faux-pas, the 73-year-old crooner at least managed to match his shoes and sunglasses to his suit . Leading man: Andy Murray celebrates his win against South African Kevin Anderson in three straight sets . His career was overshadowed by fines, disqualifications and suspensions caused by his frequent temper tantrums. But he remained well liked off court . and, with his dashing good looks, the four-times married star was . reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women. Since the age of nine, British number two Laura Robson and Canadian player Eugenie Bouchard (pictured above) have toured the world together, becoming firm friends in the process. And yesterday Miss Bouchard managed to reach Wimbledon’s quarter-finals – but while her career is flourishing, her friendship with 20-year-old Miss Robson appears to have floundered. Asked on Twitter who her best friend in tennis was yesterday, Miss Robson – who had to miss the tournament because of a wrist injury – made no reference to her former confidante, saying: ‘I am friends with most of the Americans and Australians.’ And at the French Open last month, Miss Bouchard, 20, declared: ‘My best friend on tour? I don’t have one. I don’t think the tour is the place to have friends.’ The player could be modelling herself on her childhood heroine, Maria Sharapova, who likes to distance herself from her rivals. However Miss Robson seems to be more than happy to socialise with her fellow players, heading to London’s hottest restaurant Chiltern Firehouse with Caroline Wozniacki last Friday. Also catching the eye yesterday was . Sir Cliff Richard in a garish striped blue suit and clashing tie, teamed . with a red rose in his buttonhole and tinted blue sunglasses. But even more startling was the Wimbledon Championships pass clasped in the 73-year-old singer’s hand. His ID badge included a passport photograph which appeared to be at least 20 years out of date and showed him with a shorter, cropped hair style and almost completely wrinkle-free. Sir Cliff signed autographs for tennis fans as he walked through the grounds before taking his seat on Centre Court beside Sir Trevor McDonald. The pair watched Eugenie Bouchard’s victory over Alize Cornet before staying to watch Andy Murray beat South African Kevin Anderson, 28. Murray, 27, beat his giant 6ft 8in opponent in three straight sets last night. The victory by the reigning Wimbledon champion will fuel hopes of a second consecutive title for Murray, as bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning to 5/2. After the match, Murray admitted it ‘got a bit tense’ on the court because the number 20 seed was ‘playing very well at the end and making it very tough for me’. But he said the huge support from the crowd had given him a ‘big lift’ and made the game very hard for his opponent. Murray, who is fifth in the world, was watched on court by his coach Amelie Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray as well as his girlfriend Kim Sears. Before the match, Murray’s tennis player brother Jamie suggested we might not have another champion like Murray for a century because of a lack of promotion of tennis in Britain. He said his brother is ‘not going to be around for ever’, adding: ‘Who knows when the next top British guy is going to be? That could be 50 years, 100 years, no one knows.’ Jamie, who is competing in both the men’s and mixed doubles this year, said successful players in Britain were still a product of luck rather than as a result of receiving the ‘right opportunities’.", "reference": "Ilie Nastase turned up at Wimbledon in his Romanian army uniform .\nSir Cliff Richard wore a striped blue suit with matching glasses and shoes .\nThey both watched UK's Andy Murray go through to the quarter final ."}

Heavy discounting took a toll on U.S. retail sales during the Thanksgiving weekend as shoppers spent almost 3 percent less than they did a year earlier, according to data released Sunday by an industry group. That could be an indication of a more difficult season ahead for many retailers. One bright spot this weekend, according to the data, was e-commerce, as online sales soared. The National Retail Federation estimated the average shopper spent $407.02 over the weekend, or 3.9 percent less than during the same weekend last year, because of lower prices it said would persist through the rest of the season. 'Retailers will continue to aggressively promote their in-store and online offerings, looking to entice today's very budget-conscious and value-focused shopper,' said NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay. The NRF said 141 million people went shopping at least once during the holiday weekend, up from 139 million last year. But total spending was expected to reach $57.4 billion for the four-day period - which includes Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year - down 2.8 percent from $59.1 billion over the same weekend in 2012. Where is everyone? Retail figures say sales are down almost 3 per cent this year compared with 2012. It seems many are choosing to avoid stores, such as Macy's flagship in Herald Square (pictured on Black Friday) and go online, with e-commerce up 17.3 per cent . The big deals will also dent profit margins, analysts said. 'Sales will go up, but gross margins are going to be down. Doorbusters were what people were shopping for, more than the regular-priced stuff,' said Ron Friedman, retail practice leader at the consulting firm Marcum LLP. The Thanksgiving weekend is an early gauge of consumer mood and intentions in a season that generates about 30 percent of sales and nearly 40 percent of profit for retailers. But many have given modest forecasts for the quarter. Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it expects no growth in its U.S. comparable sales, and Macy's Inc didn't raise its full-year sales forecast despite strong numbers last quarter. The shorter holiday period this year - there are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared with 2012 - prompted retailers to begin offering bargains on Monday, earlier than usual, something Shay said likely pulled some sales forward to the first part of the week. The NRF stuck to its forecast for retail sales to rise 3.9 percent for the whole season. Dramatic discounts are being blamed for the drop in sales figures this year . Chad Hastings, the general manager of Town East Mall in Mesquite, Texas, near Dallas, said shoppers were even more focused this year on specials, noting a higher correlation between the timing of doorbusters and the rise in shopper traffic at his mall over the weekend. 'Retailers are doing whatever they can to get that wallet share earlier,' Hastings said. Town East Mall's anchor tenants include J.C. Penney, Macy's and Sears. ComScore Inc, an analytics firm, said U.S. online sales rose 17.3 percent on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, outpacing sales growth at brick-and-mortar stores. ComScore has forecast a 16 percent jump in online sales for the season, helped by greater use of mobile devices. People stand outside a Prada store on 5th Ave during Black Friday Sales in New York November 29, 2013. Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving Day holiday, has traditionally been the busiest shopping day in the United States . The most visited e-commerce sites in order were those of Amazon.com Inc, eBay Inc, Walmart, Best Buy Co Inc and Target Corp, comScore said. Retailers are also being aggressive online as they look to benefit from Cyber Monday, which falls on December 2 this year. Cyber Monday is the biggest sales day of the year for e-commerce. J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's were among retailers that had already begun their 'Cyber Monday' sales on Sunday, looking to keep the momentum going. Target was calling the occasion 'Cyber Week'. Black Friday shoppers carry away discounted items from a Best Buy on Thanksgiving Day in Naples, Florida . The NRF predicted 131 million Americans would shop online on Cyber Monday, compared with 129 million last year. RetailNext, an analytics firm, found overall shopper traffic between Wednesday and Friday fell 5.2 percent and that customers went to fewer different stores, doing more online research beforehand. But shoppers spent more money in the stores they did go to, and Shelley Kohan, vice president, retail consulting at RetailNext, said that a website good enough to make shoppers want to visit a store is more crucial now than ever. 'Shoppers have more options,' Kohan said.", "reference": "In-store shopping down by 3 per cent over Thanksgiving weekend .\nMajor discounts being blamed for the drop .\nOnline retailers record rise of 17.3 per cent ."}

A father who tried to stop a shop from selling a legal high to his troubled teenage daughter ended up being arrested after losing his temper with staff. Colin Rawlingson was worried about the health of his 17-year-old daughter Nicole after she confessed she had become addicted to the drug Sky High, which gave her terrifying mood swings. So on Tuesday he went to the shop where she said she had bought to the drug in an attempt to persuade staff to stop selling the legal high to the underage girl. Every parent's nightmare: Nicole Rawlingson, 17, is addicted to legal drug Sky High . But when he raised his voice at workers in the shop in Aberdeen he was apparently targeted by security guards who forced him to the ground. Police then attended the scene and arrested the father of three, handing him an on-the-spot fine of £40 for shouting at staff. Mr Rawlingson, 62, said he was horrified to find himself painted in a bad light when he was trying to protect his vulnerable daughter. 'We've been trying to find out for a long time what has been the catalyst of her extreme behaviour,' he said. 'She told us she had been taking this substance because she was unable to purchase alcohol or cigarettes from local shops because of her age - she only looks about 12. Arrest: After Colin Rawlingson (right) filmed Nicole buying the drug in Aberdeen (left) he was detained by police . 'To prove the point we went to the shop to see if they would sell it to her. My daughter's carer filmed it on her mobile phone. 'The shop staff never asked for ID and she was just given the product. When I started complaining about this, I raised my voice. 'The next thing I know these two security guards pushed me to the ground.' The recruitment executive said the men lay on top of him for 15 minutes while waiting for police to arrive after they had thrown him face-down on the floor. 'My daughter was going berserk at this point,' Mr Rawlingson said. 'She was terrified - and so was I. 'I could hardly breathe and I thought at one point I was going to die. Mood swings: The teenager has been behaving increasingly erratically since taking the drug . While the exact make-up of the drug sold as 'Sky High' is unclear due to its semi-legal status, it appears to be a synthetic cannabinoid similar to the drug 'Spice'. Such substances imitate the effects of marijuana, relaxing users and giving them a 'trippy' sensation, although they do not contain any of the same ingredients as the natural drug. Users have described Sky High as 'very, very potent', far more powerful than ordinary strains of cannabis. The drug has not been specifically outlawed under current anti-narcotic legislation, but cannot be advertised for human consumption. Similar substances are usually marketed as 'herbal blends', and are sometimes specifically labelled as being unsuitable for ingestion. 'Then the police arrived and put handcuffs on me and took me into a police van in full view of everyone on the street. 'I've . never had any trouble with police. I didn't assault anyone - I just . raised my voice as anyone would have done as a concerned parent.' Mr Rawlingson said that his daughter had been behaving increasingly erratically over the preceding months - and had even tried to run away from home. The teenager has kicked in walls and ripped panels off doors at her family home in Blackburn, near Aberdeen, and her panic attacks mean she can no longer sleep on her own. Nicole's family had no idea what was triggering her mood swings until she admitted she had been regularly smoking the synthetic cannabis drug over the past year. It is sold in a clear tube labelled 'Sky High', with no indication of what the product actually contains. 'Because it is a legal high she thinks it's OK,' Mr Rawlingson said. 'She's been taking it two or three times a week for a year. 'If they are going to sell legal highs they should come with health warnings. But I think these shops need to be closed down.'", "reference": "Nicole Rawlingson, 17, has been behaving erratically since taking Sky High .\nFather Colin went to market store where she bought drug and berated staff .\nPushed to ground by security staff and fined £40 by police for disruption ."}

The scrolls, some dating back as far as the 3rd century, are being sold on eBay for large sums of money, but experts fear that private collectors are damaging the precious papyrus. A 4.5in by 1.5in rectangular scrap of paper featuring 15 lines of Homer's The Iliad, jotted down by an Egyptian scribe in the 4th century, recently sold online for £16,000. Ancient papyrus scrolls are being sold in online auctions, with experts fearing the manuscripts could be damaged. This section of Paul's Epistle to the Romans was bought at Sotheby's for £301,000 . In another sale, a third century parchment sheet containing a section of Paul's Epistle to the Romans was bought at Sotheby's for £301,000, astonishing experts. While neither of these sales were unlawful, scholars fear some buyers are carving up larger scrolls to sell online for profit. Brice Jones, a papyrologist and lecturer in New Testament and Early Christianity at Concordia University in Montreal, told the Sunday Telegraph that private collectors were also damaging the ancient manuscripts. A 4.5in by 1.5in rectangular scrap of paper featuring 15 lines The Iliad, by Homer (marble bust pictured), sold for £16,000, astonishing experts . He said: 'The study of ancient papyri is a fascinating field of historical inquiry, because these artifacts are the fingerprints of real people from a bygone era. 'Each time I study a new papyrus, it is as if I am peeking over the shoulders of the scribe who wrote it, eavesdropping on a conversation that in many cases was meant to be private: an argument between a husband and wife, a divorce contract, an invitation to dinner, a letter between a father and son. 'But when private collectors acquire papyri for personal enjoyment and restrict scholarly access to them, the immediate consequence is that we lose valuable historical information that would otherwise advance our knowledge about ancient people.' One example Mr Jones used was that of the papyrus codex of the Gospel of Judas, which was stored in safety deposit box by its owner and then placed in a freezer as the collector believed that was the best way to preserve it. 'The results of these decisions were horrifying: the codex crumbled into many hundreds of tiny pieces and what was once a virtually complete codex was now badly deteriorated and difficult to restore,' Mr Jones said. The papyrus expert added that he spends hours trawling through auction websites, such as eBay, looking for scrolls being sold, as well as forgeries. An eBay spokesman said sellers on the website 'must ensure listings comply with our clear policy on artifacts. We work with regulators, law enforcement and other parties including the Egyptian Embassy to apply this policy, and if a listing of concern is identified we will require proof that it was legally exported and remove any listing where this proof is not provided.'", "reference": "Papyrus scrolls have started selling online for thousands of pounds .\nAncient manuscripts could be damaged or destroyed, experts fear .\nScrap of paper from 4th century Egypt recently sold online for £16,000 .\nScholars say some private collectors do not know how to store scrolls .\nOne precious artefact crumbled after a buyer kept it inside a freezer ."}

'With the tests I have done the doctors have figured out that I was infected within the last month...My antibodies just showed up on a test this week which is scary because they didn't a week ago,' he said in two other tweets. A trade group representing producers of pornographic movies in Los Angeles called on any of Daily's sexual partners to be tested for the virus. However, the group, the Free Speech Coalition, stepped short of calling for a moratorium on adult film productions. Positive attitude: Daily, who has been in the adult film industry for eight years, said that hopefully this will encourage porn stars to wear condoms . Out in the open: Daily announced his positive diagnosis on Twitter Tuesday . The group said it could not yet confirm whether Daily truly had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, but it warned his partners to be tested. The Free Speech Coalition were the ones to confirm on August 22 that the actress who goes by the name of Cameron Bay was also infected with HIV. Daily has been linked romantically to Bay on the adult film industry website XBiz.com. California Assemblyman Isadore Hall, who has been trying for months to get a bill passed in the state Assembly mandating the use of condoms in sex scenes, said Daily's reported infection shows the need for such a regulation. 'This is the second individual within a week and a half to contract HIV in the industry,' said Hall, a Democrat. 'There will probably be more.'

{"id": 15126, "article": "By . Mark Duell . Supermarket workers had a huge shock when they spotted a live scorpion inside a pack of bananas. The 3in-long venomous creature travelled more than 5,000 miles from Costa Rica to a village shop in Cornwall by stowing away among the fruit. Angela Parren, a sales assistant at Nisa Phoenix Stores in St Stephen-in-Brannel, spotted something moving as she restocked shelves. As she lent in for a closer look, the scorpion scuttled into view. Venomous: The scorpion which was found in a banana bag at the store in St Stephen-in-Brannel, Cornwall . Alive: Zookeepers soon identified the creature as a juvenile black edged scorpion from South America . The 51-year-old called for help and co-workers moved the pack to a store room before calling police and the RSPCA. They were urged to contact nearby Newquay Zoo who offered to give it a new home. Zookeepers soon identified the arachnid as a juvenile black-edged scorpion, known as centruroides limbatus. They are from South America - native to Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica. The species is not considered a major threat to humans but experts say a sting can still be extremely painful and in rare cases can leave people needing hospital treatment. Les Howell, owner of Nisa Phoenix Stores, said: ‘We didn't know what to do with it. It didn't seem right to kill it, so we phoned our wholesaler for advice. Scary: Assistant Angela Parren and owner Leslie Howell, from Nisa Phoenix Stores, who found the scorpion . Location: The incident happened at the Nisa Phoenix Stores (pictured) in St Stephen-in-Brannel, Cornwall . Centruroides limbatus, also known as black-edged scorpions, are often found in crevices near the ground. They are known to inhabit Honduras and Nicaragua, but are most commonly found in Costa Rica. The scorpions are known to frequent human dwellings with plenty of food and shelter. Experts say that although they are not considered hugely dangerous to humans, they are venomous and a sting would be painful. The species were first recorded by British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in 1898. ‘They suggested we phone the police, who suggested the RSPCA, who suggested DEFRA (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), who were closed for the Bank Holiday. ‘So we phoned Newquay Zoo and spoke to Gareth O'Dare, who is the Tropical House keeper. 'He suggested we take it out to the zoo, which we did after putting the whole bag of bananas inside a secure plastic box. ‘He told us that it was a juvenile black-edged scorpion which is native to Costa Rica where the bananas came from. 'Although a sting from its tail won't kill humans, it will still pack a punch.’ St Stephen-in-Brannel is six miles west of St Austell, with a population of more than 5,000. Last month a family was forced to flee their home and have it fumigated after finding hundreds of potentially deadly spiders - in a bunch of bananas. Shocked father Jamie Roberts, 31, of Hednesford, Staffordshire, spotted white patches covering pieces of the fruit from a OneStop shop after he put them in a bowl - but assumed this was mould. However, upon closer inspection, he realised the fruit was infested with a spider nest - and immediately rang pest controllers who advised his family to leave their home immediately. OneStop said that the type of spider had not yet been identified - and a sample of the arachnid had been sent to Natural History Museum experts for tests. It is not clear if these have been completed. A 29-year-old housewife found spiders on her Sainbsury’s bananas - suspected to be Brazilian wandering spiders, one of the world’s most venomous types, whose bite can kill within two hours. Consi Taylor and her husband Richard, 37, of Hampton, south-west London, had to spend three nights in a hotel last autumn with their children while their house was fumigated and deep-cleaned. She had taken the fruit from a £1 bunch of Colombian Fair Trade bananas bought in a Sainsbury’s, and eaten about half when she noticed the 0.1in-long dots that resembled mould or bruising. Sainsbury’s gave Mrs Taylor a £10 voucher when she returned the fruit. The store said it had ‘rigorous controls on imported products at all stages, which is why this is so rare’. Last June, a 42-year-old shopper picked up a bunch of supermarket bananas from his local Lidl and found a large tarantula hanging off. Mark Drinkwater said he was left with his 'heart beating through his chest' after discovering the spider, which he claimed was the size of his hand. The tarantula, thought to have come with the imported bananas from Colombia, was caught by shop staff in a box and put in a freezer at the back of the store in Sydenham, south-east London. And in 2008, a branch of Tesco in Chatham, Kent was forced to close after a terrified worker spotted a highly-venomous Brazilian Wandering Spider on a banana.", "reference": "3in-long venomous creature travelled 5,000 miles from Costa Rica to UK .\nArrived at Nisa village shop in Cornwall by stowing away among the fruit .\nSales assistant, 51, spotted something moving as she restocked shelves .\nNewquay Zoo experts found arachnid was juvenile black-edged scorpion ."}

Gen. Than Shwe received a ceremonial reception in the sandstone presidential palace in New Delhi before he drove to the shrine to India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi to pay homage. Indian president Pratibha Devisingh Patil, prime minister Manmohan Singh, members of his cabinet and several top bureaucrats greeted the junta leader as a state guest. The military ruler's trip underscored the close relationship between the two nations -- one seen as one of the world's most vibrant democracies and another despised by the West as a repressive regime. In 1951, the two countries signed what they called a \"treaty of friendship,\" and over the past few years, bilateral trade has soared to almost $1 billion, according to Indian officials. Several Indian companies have invested in Myanmar's energy sector. And India's main space agency has helped set up a data-processing center in Yangon for remote-sensing applications, authorities in New Delhi say. Than Shwe's visit began on Sunday with a tour of sacred Buddhist sites in eastern India. It came days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with UN human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements. \"It is critical that Burma hear from you, its neighbors,\" she said in a speech at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting.

{"id": 15129, "article": "In North Korea's utopian society, the very words \"human rights\" do not need to exist -- because it's so perfect, the regime maintains. The North Korean regime controls and monitors the usage of the very words. The concept is not even taught. I had never even heard of the term \"human rights\" when I was in North Korea. It also strongly denies the existence of the political prison camp system throughout the country. It maintains this position even though I was born in the most infamous, political prison camp in North Korea: Camp 14. Even now, there are people who are born into a life of an inmate in a political prison camp. North Korea also denies committing human rights violations, threatens and intimidates defector activists working to raise awareness of human rights issues, and attacking and criticizing those who have testified during the United Nations Commission of Inquiry's investigation, calling these defectors \"human scum.\" North Korea has also launched personal attacks on me, labeling me \"human scum\" and releasing a statement that my testimony is all based on lies. The dictatorship in North Korea has never been honest or truthful for more than six decades it has been in existence. Could North Korea change? The North Korean dictatorial regime should not just emptily deny that these political prison camps exist. If they are truly honorable and fair they should immediately allow an international inspection delegation, comprised of myself and organizations such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch, or the United Nations, to be able to conduct on-the-ground visitations to the political prison camps. These delegations must include political prison survivors like myself and other defectors. Only recently did they concede that \"labor detention centers\" exist, but solely for the incarcerated to have their lives improved \"through their mentality and to look on their wrongdoings.\" Earlier this year, the UN published a report on the human rights situation in North Korea, through the Commission of Inquiry that was established last year. It was followed by a special North Korean human rights side event during the recent UN General Assembly in New York in which U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, and the Foreign Ministers of Japan and South Korea demanded improvements in North Korea's human rights record. To counter this, and perhaps fearing a challenge to its stability and of losing the initiative, the regime adamantly opposed and obstructed any discussions at the UN of a resolution regarding its rights record, as well as the issue being brought up at the Security Council. I believe ultimately the regime is using diplomatic tactics to deflect pressures from the international community regarding its nuclear ambitions, missile tests and human rights violations. Regime travels freely as North Koreans starve . Some say that the most recent actions and conciliatory gestures on the part of the North Korean regime can lead to the revival of six-party talks and progress on the nuclear issue. But these talks have happened many times before, and the regime still goes ahead and conducts nuclear tests in a bid to become a nuclear power. This has showed the abject failure of the objectives of the six-party talks to denuclearize the peninsula. Even if negotiations were to be restarted, the attitude of the regime must change first -- most importantly by ceasing its provocative behavior. PHOTOS: The scale of North's camp system . However, though there may be a temporary détente in tensions if the regime were to participate in restarted talks, it would be difficult to expect a fundamental change in attitude on the part of the North Korean regime. Also, the human rights issue must be on the same level as the nuclear issue and dealt with together, and for this to happen, the human rights issue must be included as an integral part of six-party talks. The international community must show continued interest and become actively involved. The dictator's family travel freely, while ordinary North Koreans cannot enjoy any freedom of travel. People are dying of hunger while the North Korean dictator wastes money on building a useless golf course and earns money from Western tourism, which both angers and saddens me. The dictatorship in Pyongyang says its citizens chose the system in North Korea through their own will and that they are happy. But there is no place, no country on this Earth where the people would knowingly choose a system that starves and kills its own citizens and be happy. Footnote: . The North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri released videos about Shin Dong-hyuk this week, calling his testimonies lies. The video featured a man, Sin Kyong Sop, whom Shin recognized to be his father. In the video, which has English subtitles, Sin denies they lived at a prison camp. In response, Shin Dong-hyuk released this statement: . \"My only 'sin' against the North Korean dictator is that I told the entire world about the suffering of the political prison inmates in the political prison camps.

An electrician caught doing 131mph in a Vauxhall Corsa while on his way to a garage specialising in engine modifications has been banned from driving for 12 weeks. Neil Robert Edwards, 24, from Mynydd Isa near Mold, in Wales, was spotted by police hurtling along the A55  at nearly twice the 70mph speed limit despite the wet conditions. When officers stopped Edwards to ask him where he was going, he told them he was rushing to 'Demon Tweeks', a garage which sells parts to tune up car engines. Realising what he had done, Edwards then asked officers: 'Is there nothing we can do about this?' He was today banned from driving for 12 weeks at Flintshire Magistrates’ Court as well as being fined £300 plus £115 in costs. A standard model Vauxhall Corsa comes with a 1.2 litre engine and is capable of a top speed of 107mph. Prosecutor Gareth Jones told the court that when Edwards was caught on February 15 the road was wet but it had stopped raining. He said that such cases were sometimes charged as dangerous driving because of the excessive speed but the defendant had been charged simply with speeding as the roads had been so empty at the time.

Egypts' army generals made a last minute grab for power yesterday as Islamists claimed to have won the presidential election. The country’s military rulers have issued a constitutional decree to limit the influence of the new president at the same time as granting the army sweeping legislative authority – even permitting generals to control the budget. The move threatens to undermine the election battle between Islamist Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood and Ahmed Shafiq, who served as prime minister under Mubarak. Victory: Presidential candidate Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood waves to a crowd . Morsi, 60, declared victory as votes . were still being counted, with his campaign team saying he had won 52 . per cent of the vote and Shafiq had 48 per cent. If confirmed, the results would see the leader of an Islamist group become the first democratically-elected president of Egypt. A spokesman for the Shafiq campaign . instead said the former air force commander was ahead with around 51 per . cent of the vote. No results are expected to be announced until . Thursday. Gunfight: Israeli police and soldiers detained an Arab-Israeli after he tried to pass a road block . Looking: Israel is still hunting for four gunmen who infiltrated the Egyptian border and staged a deadly ambush . Unclear: There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, about 18 miles from the Gaza Strip . Worries: The incident raised Israeli concern about lawlessness in Egypt's Sinai desert since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 . Last night, the US government voiced its concern over the military powers. State Department spokesman Victoria . Nuland said: ‘This is a critical moment in Egypt, and the world is . watching closely. We are particularly concerned by decisions that appear . to prolong the military’s hold on power.’ Pentagon press secretary George . Little said the US would urge military leaders ‘to relinquish power to . civilian elected authorities and to respect the universal rights of the . Egyptian people and the rule of law’. Many have described the actions of . the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since the . fall of President Hosni Mubarak, as a military coup. Last week, a constitutional court . believed to favour the generals ruled that the country’s . Islamist-dominated parliament – which was democratically elected into . office – must be dissolved. The justice ministry also imposed a . de facto martial law granting the military police extensive powers to . arrest civilians for non-military crimes. As well as handing the military . legislative power until a new parliament is elected, the decree also . ensures the army remains unaccountable and grants it the right to . oversee the writing of a new constitution. Protest: Egyptians gathered to demonstrate in Tahrir Square last week in the run up to the election . Egyptian stocks opened lower today after the election brought the country no closer to the stable democracy promised by its interim military rulers. The uncertain outcome of the vote, billed as the last step in an army-managed transition to democracy, is the latest in a series of false starts. It has left investors swinging between optimism and despondency since the overthrow of autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak in February last year. Sixteen months since Mubarak's departure, the country lacks a functioning government with popular backing to replace a hapless, unpopular interim cabinet and embark on reforms to prop up a struggling economy. After posting the world's best stock market performance between January and March following a smooth parliamentary vote, Egypt's benchmark share index has dropped 20 per cent. Major General Mohammed al-Assar, a . senior member of the ruling council, told a press conference yesterday . that the army would hand over power to a civil state by June 30. Meanwhile three were killed in a gunfight on the Israeli/Egyptian border today. Militants . fired on an Israeli crew building a border barrier on the frontier, . killing one of the workers - while Israeli soldiers shot dead two of the . infiltrators. The incident raised Israeli concern about lawlessness in Egypt's Sinai desert. 'We . can see a disturbing deterioration in Egypt's control of the Sinai's . security,' Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said, commenting on the . attack. He added, in reference to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel: 'We are waiting for the election results. 'Whoever wins, we expect him to take responsibility over all of Egypt's international commitments.' The scream: A man walks in front of a wall representing the Syrisa revolution in Cairo . Hosni Mubarak, pictured as he was sentenced, was toppled in an Arab Spring uprising last year . Israeli . military spokesman Yoav Mordechai said: 'A terrorist squad opened fire . and possibly also fired an anti-tank rocket at an area where (Israel) is . constructing the border fence.' An Israeli military source said one of the workmen, an Arab citizen of Israel, was killed by the gunmen. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, about 18 miles from the Gaza Strip. Soldiers who rushed to the scene . killed two of the militants and searched the Israeli side of the border . for more gunmen, the source said. To . curb an influx of African migrants and boost security, Israel is . building a fence along the frontier with Egypt that it hopes to complete . by the end of the year. The barrier will run most of the 165 miles from Eilat, on the Red Sea, up to the Gaza Strip. In . the most serious attack in the area since the Egyptian popular . uprising, militants crossed over the Egyptian border and killed eight . Israelis in August 2011. On . Saturday, at least two rockets were fired deep into southern Israel, . causing no damage or casualties. It was not clear whether they were . launched from Gaza or Sinai. Palestinian . militants in the Gaza Strip, ruled by Islamist Hamas, have launched . Grad rockets at Israel from the coastal territory in the past.

Tower Hamlets council is already under investigation for alleged fraud after mayor Lutfur Rahman doubled recommended funding to Bengali-run charities in an apparent attempt to buy favour. But now a leaked government report suggests  the mayor and his finance minister, Alibor Choudhury, have links to Islamic extremist groups, including one seeking to set up a Sharia state in Europe. Lutfur Rahman, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, is being investigated over allegations of fraud and has now been linked to extremist groups, as has Alibor Choudhury, his finance minister . A document handed to The Sunday Telegraph says that three community centres owned by the council, or by their housing authority, were used for meetings of radical groups including al-Muhajiroun, the banned Islamist terrorist organisation founded by Omar Bakri Mohammed and Anjem Choudary . A third was used by political hate group Hizb ut-Tahrir and 'may still be' in use, according to the report which was prepared for David Cameron in 2013. Another cause for concern is the council's £2million of funding given partially to the East London Mosque, which previously held a telephone Q&A with al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. They have links to the Islamic Forum of Europe which is seeking to set up a Sharia state within Europe. The council's new finance minister, Alibor Choudhury, has close connections to the organisation as do other senior council officers. Earlier this week police and investigators were called to the council to assess whether Mr Rahman had deliberately doubled funding to Bengali-run charities in the hope of buying favour. Mr Rahman was also accused by Panorama of increasing public funding to Bangladeshi and Somali groups from £1.5 million to £3.6 million in the face of officer recommendations. The mayor has denied all the claims, which he claims are motivated by racism and Islamophobia. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has sent inspectors into the council to work alongside police . Speaking to Mail Online, a DCLG spokesman said: 'It is a matter of public record that Ministers have long been concerned about a worrying pattern of divisive community politics and alleged mismanagement of public money by the mayoral administration in Tower Hamlets. 'Separately, Ministers are also minded to use their new powers under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 to take action against councils continuing inappropriate spending of taxpayers’ money, and Brandon Lewis has written to Tower Hamlets about this.' The spokesman added that, as the report was leaked, the department would not be commenting on allegations of extremism. A spokesman for Tower Hamlets council said: 'Tower Hamlets has a strong record in partnership working with many different agencies in tackling and preventing extremism from Office of Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) funded projects to our Prevent programmes, receiving Home Office sign off to working with Stonewall on faith and sexuality. 'Our approach to diversity, equality and social cohesion has been recognised by our peers and is reflected in the ‘Excellent’ rating received from the Local Government Association.'

{"id": 15136, "article": "Each year, 75,000 witnesses identify criminal suspects. Yet, as the New Jersey Supreme Court has acknowledged in a recent landmark case, there is \"a troubling lack of reliability in eyewitness identifications.\" In fact, given the risk of executing an innocent person, 16 states ban capital punishment. Yet, in Georgia, Troy Davis faces execution on Wednesday, even though seven out of nine witnesses have recanted their testimony against him. A study released Monday by the American Judicature Society, analyzing 850 photographic lineups, found that mistakes in identification are often related to how the photos of a line-up are presented. It found if a person uninvolved in the case presents the photos one-by-one, rather than all at once, fewer mistakes are made. Another critical factor is whether the authority presenting the photos knows who the suspect is. But it's not only the method of presentation that is skewing justice. It's also fear. I know.  I had my own bout with mistaken eyewitness testimony. A few years ago, on a bright clear sunny afternoon, I was driving on an empty Connecticut country road when a man ran out in front of my car from a field to my left, carrying a VCR in his arms.  The movement, and his incongruous burden, drew my attention. The man froze when he saw my car, and as I passed him our eyes met for a very long moment in the rear-view mirror. I will never forget the jolt of that confrontation.  I didn't understand at the time what I was seeing, but the fear, and something wilder, that I saw in his eyes was palpable. After I passed, he dodged into the bushes on the other side of the road and disappeared. I went on to do the errands of the day, while puzzling about the meaning of what I had just seen.  Four hours later I decided to tell this experience to the police. It was then I found out there had been a robbery in that neighborhood, a VCR had been stolen and a suspect caught.  But before he had been arrested, the suspect shot a police officer, who was in the hospital badly wounded.  The police asked me to make an  identification from a photographic lineup. Here is what I did: Three separate times, I pointed out a photograph of a man with a beard as the man I had seen on the road. As I learned from the subsequent unfolding of the case, the man I had seen on the road had no beard. In four hours, of course, he hadn't had time to grow one.  There was no way that the photograph to which I pointed could have been a picture of the man who was under arrest. I chose the photograph of another man because meeting the suspect's eyes in the rear-view mirror had shocked me so much -- even though I had no conscious knowledge that he had a gun -- that I refused to recognize his face. It was probably because, subconsciously, I never wanted to see him again. This is what it can mean to be a witness to violence. You are not a rational spectator. It doesn't matter if a photograph is set in front of you that depicts the real criminal and no one influences you improperly.  You can still choose an innocent man. We can analyze all the numbers we want, but until we acknowledge more fully the role emotions play, we won't have the data required for the policies we need. Other factors are also instrumental, according to the New Jersey Supreme Court. Findings can be influenced by whether the witness is under a lot of stress, whether the sighting is brief or a weapon is visible, if the witness is a different race from the suspect.  The court recommended that juries be better instructed in how these and other factors can affect the ability to remember correctly. But the AJS study's conclusion is stark: Even if the photos are viewed one by one, culprits were correctly identified only 27% of the time.  According to The Innocence Project, 76% of those who were exonerated based on DNA evidence were convicted, at least in part, by eyewitness accounts. I am a historian of photography and a scholar of visual studies.  I have made my living and my reputation by the sharpness with which I can see, remember and recount the details and meaning of photographs.  By the time I was asked to make this identification from a set of photographs, I had been practicing this profession for over a quarter of a century.  I was used to looking at all kinds of photographs, even mug shots, which are an area of interest for contemporary artists and cultural critics. And I got it wrong. Until we understand what happens when people look at photographs they don't want to see, we will not get the data that will drive better policy. We will continue to get wrongful identifications, wrongful convictions and worse, wrongful executions.", "reference": "Laura Wexler:  7 out of 9 witnesses recanted testimony against Troy Davis .\nStudies find witness testimony notoriously unreliable, she says, including in photo lineups .\nWexler, whose specialty is photos and memory, made incorrect ID of suspect .\nWexler: Fear and emotion play a large role in whether you recognize a suspect ."}
{"id": 15137, "article": "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- You've got your spot on a lounge chair angled into the hot Caribbean sun, with tall, slender palm trees jutting out over your head. As you gaze at the calm turquoise waters and sip that refreshing rum drink, you may ask yourself, \"What more could I possibly want?\" Visitors can climb the tower at Fortaleza Ozama for a view over the rooftops and out to sea. For many travelers to the Dominican Republic, that chair -- usually secluded inside a mega all-inclusive resort complex -- is the sole destination. And don't get me wrong, it's a great one. The Dominican Republic's stretches of sand are some of the best on the planet. But if you never leave the high walls of your tourist compound, you're missing out on a gem of a capital city. Santo Domingo is the New World's first city, with 16th-century buildings, quaint colonial streets, romantic ruins and a lively atmosphere. All you need is a full day to experience the city's architecture, culture and food. Plus, it's only a $9 coach bus ride from Punta Cana. So when you begin to tire of the antics of the \"animation team\" at the resort, and the color of your skin starts to resemble the papaya or watermelon you're eating, consider a short trip to Santo Domingo. Founded soon after Christopher Columbus set foot in the New World, and run by his son Diego, the city became the colonial capital of the Americas and launch pad for further Spanish expeditions. Despite several raids by pirates, the oldest section of town remains largely intact. Known as the Zona Colonial, it contains many European \"firsts\" in the Western Hemisphere including the first street, cathedral, hospital and university. How to see it all in a day . Start at the heart of the zone, Parque Colón, a square that borders the cathedral and is always full of life. You can sit and watch children chase pigeons as you gaze up at the simple beauty of the oldest cathedral in the Americas. Next, head over to the oldest fortress in the New World, Fortaleza Ozama, built in the early 1500s. There you can climb the tower for a view over the rooftops and out to sea. Back on street level, walk up a couple blocks to the expansive Plaza España, site of two museums and a hangout for locals, especially in the evening, when kids crisscross the square on scooters or fly kites, and couples sit quietly together. The Museo de las Casas Reales and the Alcázar de Colón -- Diego Columbus' palace -- show you how the wealthy Spanish lived when they came to the early colonies and provide some history of the island's colonization -- all for a buck or two. Next, head over to a pair of impressive ruins. Gaze up at the towering walls and arches of the Americas' first hospital, Hospital de San Nicolás de Bari. Then, just up a picturesque bend in the road lined with colorful houses, you'll find the large ruins of Monasterio de San Francisco. Pirate attacks and earthquakes brought down the monastery. The hospital was merely abandoned in the 18th century, and later dismantled for safety. Now let yourself wander a bit through the streets, checking out the colorful surprises around every colonial corner. You'll discover the varied architecture of people's homes, and get a view into Dominican city life. In just a few blocks, I ran across a pickup game of baseball, the national sport and passion, in the middle of the street, with adults using just a broom handle and roll of tape; several \"kiddie\" pools in the streets, where both children and adults were cooling off in the afternoon heat; and a handful of corner parks alive with activity. After exploring, your final destination is the zone's main drag, Calle El Conde. This pedestrian-only street is the place to shop. You'll find street sellers hawking colorful artwork; music stores to pick up that merengue and bachata music you've heard blaring out of everyone's stereos; and jewelry shops featuring native amber and the sky-blue stone larimar found only in the Dominican Republic. By now, you've certainly worked up an appetite walking in the hot sun. Parque Colón and Plaza España each have a row of chic sidewalk cafés, although they're a bit pricey and touristy. Consider wandering a bit through some side streets to find a more local establishment, where you can feast on typical cuisine such as la bandera dominicana (a red beans and rice dish), several stews, fried plantains or yucca and delicious tropical fruits. And if you still feel like dancing the night away, hop in a taxi to the Malecón, Santo Domingo's seafront boulevard, where the large hotels have popular dance clubs pumping merengue until the wee hours of the morning. The bus ride . Getting to the capital city from the beach areas is cheap and relatively easy. Expreso Bávaro runs from the Punta Cana area for $9 in an air-conditioned and comfy coach bus. On your four-hour ride, you'll get a glimpse of some smaller Dominican towns, a towering modern cathedral, distant mountains and vast sugarcane fields. Metro and Caribe Tours provide similar services from the beaches on the north coast around Puerto Plata. The buses to/from Punta Cana don't run long into the evening (they leave each side at 7 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m.), so you'll want to make this an overnight trip. The Zona Colonial has several boutique hotels that are quaint, clean and reasonably priced. You could even arrange to fly out of Santo Domingo's Las Americas airport, rather than Punta Cana.", "reference": "Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic's capital, was the New World's first city .\nExplore 16th-century buildings, colonial streets, romantic ruins and Dominican city life .\nCheap, comfortable buses connect to the city from beach areas ."}
{"id": 15138, "article": "A grandfather who built a fake bomb and planted it outside a Jobcentre after his benefits were temporarily stopped has been jailed for two years. William Harkin crafted the device using an analogue clock, wires and tape, before placing it in a brown paper package outside the building in Middleton, Greater Manchester. Manchester Crown Court heard how the 54-year-old had originally intended to stage a rooftop protest and unfurl a banner over the building, but decided to make the fake bomb instead. William Harkin, 54 (left) left a fake bomb (right) outside the Jobcentre in Middleton, Greater Manchester, after his jobseekers' allowance was suspended for three months . Harkin, originally from Northern Ireland, carried out the hoax the day after the 18th anniversary of the IRA bombings in Manchester. It came after his jobseekers' allowance was suspended for three months, after he missed a number of college courses designed to help him get a job. After planting the fake bomb in June this year, the court heard how Harkin rang police from a nearby phone box pretending to be a concerned passer-by. Police raced to the scene and cordoned off the area for five hours. An electronic Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot established the bomb was a fake and disposed of it in a small controlled explosion. While at the scene, officers found Harkin loitering in the same phonebox from which he had made the emergency call. He was taken in for questioning where he confessed to the crime. He claimed he was 'upset' that his state handouts were to be halted and said it was an act of 'abject stupidity and foolishness'. Manchester Crown Court heard Harkin has previous convictions for the same offence in his home country. He also has a previous conviction for providing information to a terrorist as part a spate of offences in the early 1980s. Passing sentence Judge Leslie Hull told him: 'There was a sense of grievance towards the Department for Work and Pensions for the suspension of your benefits without, what you thought, was just cause. The scene was cordoned off for five hours after Harkin - who made the hoax bomb out of an analogue clock and wires - phoned 999 pretending to be a concerned passer-by . 'What was said about you was that this was a gesture you were making towards them. A gesture it may have been but none of the features which are dealt with justify what you did.

'The courts have to do what they can to deter people such as you from doing this sort of thing.'The court heard that Harkin rang police at around 4.50am to tell them there was a 'suspicious package' outside the benefits agency and gave the address.

'He pointed out where the device was and they found a brown paper package. Poking through was a full clock fires with wires coming out. 'He said he had been on state benefits for some time and had been on various courses to assist him. 'He had missed some of these courses and therefore the benefits agency had written to him indicating that his benefits were going to be suspended for three months. 'As a result he built the package with the intention of upsetting those who had been there.' In mitigation, defence counsel Joseph Hart said Harkin had suffered since his mother and wife had died and he felt he had been 'messed about' by the benefits agency. He said: 'The resentment had built up within him and he wanted to do something to bring home to the authorities his frustration and upset at the way he had been left high and dry. 'His initial thought was to prepare a banner and do a rooftop protest but in the depths of his paranoia and upset alighted on the idea of a bomb hoax.

{"id": 15139, "article": "Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A fuel pipeline exploded in a densely populated Nairobi slum Monday morning, flattening homes, reducing some bodies to dust and forcing a massive evacuation of the area amid fears that big pools of leaked fuel could ignite, police and Kenya Red Cross officials said. At least 75 people died in the explosion and fire, said Charles Owino, a spokesman for Kenyan police. Police and Red Cross officials expected the death toll to rise. The fire erupted around 10 a.m., possibly as a group of people were siphoning fuel from the pipeline in the Sinai slum, officials said. Coming to a precise accounting of the toll may be difficult because so many of the victims were found huddled together and severely burned, said Carol Nduta, a Kenya Red Cross emergency medical instructor and dispatcher who traveled to the scene. Some of the bodies were burned to dust, she said. \"Almost the whole place blew up,\" she said. Charred bodies were strewn throughout the wreckage. Some bodies were still bobbing in a stream that passes through the settlement Monday afternoon. Red Cross officials said it would be Tuesday before they could all be recovered. Images from CNN affiliate Kenya Television Network showed flames shooting from metal-roofed buildings as firefighters and people in civilian clothing rushed to the scene and picked through the flattened remains of structures. A total of 118 people were admitted to Nairobi hospitals for treatment, police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. Authorities set up counseling centers at a stadium in the city as hospital officials made an urgent appeal for blood, saying that many of those admitted to Nairobi hospitals suffered extensive burns and would require blood transfusions to survive, state broadcaster Kenya Broadcasting Co. reported. The precise cause of the accident remained unclear. Police suspect the pipeline was punctured, possibly in an effort to steal fuel, Kiraithe said. KBC quoted Prime Minister Raila Odinga as saying the incident occurred after a mechanism on the pipeline failed, allowing fuel to spill into a drainage ditch, where it then ignited. He said the explosion was the worst energy-related disaster in the country's history. Fatalities from fuel leak accidents are common in Kenya. Scores of residents scramble to scoop up fuel whenever there is a leak or a tanker is involved in an accident. In 2009, more than 100 people died in a fire after an oil tanker overturned in Molo, in western Kenya. In that incident, someone trying to take some of the fuel lit a cigarette, starting the fire. A 2009 article in a Kenyan newspaper, The Daily Nation, discussed concerns of such a fire in the Sinai slum, where residents built shanties and even a church next to or even on top of the pipeline, according to the Daily Nation. \"I don't think there will ever be a fire, but you never know,\" the newspaper quoted one resident who it said had refused to move away from the pipeline despite eviction notices from Kenya Pipeline Company. Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta pledged the government will do its best to aid victims and investigate the cause of the incident, according to KBC. \"As Kenyans we feel a collective sense of loss and grief,\" KBC quoted him as saying. \"As leaders we ought to feel a collective sense of responsibility.\" CNN's Andreena Narayan, Faith Karimi, Lillian Leposo, Helena DeMoura and Kim Chakanetsa contributed to this report.", "reference": "The confirmed death toll rises to 75 after a Nairobi pipeline explosion .\nThe pipeline exploded Monday morning in the Sinai slum .\nPolice and Red Cross officials say the toll is likely to reach 100 .\nResidents discounted fire danger in 2009 Kenyan newspaper article ."}

{"id": 15141, "article": "Beijing (CNN) -- China's legislature meets this week to seal a power transfer to new leaders, but don't hold your breath for signs that the new team will ease up on the tough Chinese foreign policy that has ruffled feathers in its neighborhood recently. As the National People's Congress opened in Beijing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Fu Ying warned that the country had sent an \"important signal\" to the region that it would respond \"decisively\" to provocations on territorial disputes. That means we can expect Beijing to continue with its \"reactive assertiveness\" foreign policy tactic. China has perfected this approach in its ongoing maritime disputes in the South and East China Seas. The approach allows Beijing to use perceived provocations as a chance to change the status quo in its favor -- all the while insisting the other party started the trouble. In Beijing's eyes, it is a means of satisfying domestic pressure for a tougher foreign policy to match its economic might, all while trying to cling to the mantra of peaceful development. But this juggling act does not always work, and a number of countries in the region are giving up on the notion of a peacefully rising China. The prolonged deadlock with Japan over the sovereignty of a few islets offers a vivid example of this approach. In September, the Japanese government bought from a private owner three of the disputed islands -- called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China -- in the East China Sea. Japan says it purchased the islands to prevent the hardline Tokyo mayor from acquiring them and carrying out a plan to build there. Beijing interpreted the move as a betrayal of the two countries' agreement to shelve the dispute, and the subsequent months witnessed a string of Chinese retaliations that have kept tensions in the East China Sea simmering. China's retaliatory measures, termed \"combination punches\" by the state media, ranged from the verbal -- leaders labeling Japan's purchase of the islands a \"farce\" and vowing to \"never yield an inch\" -- to economic pressure, large-scale anti-Japan protests and naval exercises in the East China Sea. But the game-changer came when Beijing declared its territorial baselines around the islands, a move that legally places them under Chinese administration. Once the announcement was made, China began to regularly dispatch law enforcement vessels to patrol waters off the disputed islands, directly challenging Japan's de facto control of the area for the past 40 years. Such is the new normal, claim Chinese officials. But Beijing did not stop there. It sent a reconnaissance flight directly over the disputed islands, and Japan responded by scrambling fighter jets. The Chinese navy and air force have intensified their reconnaissance missions and drills in the East China Sea and, according to Japan, even locked weapons-guiding radar on Japanese military assets, claims China denied. Despite these actions, officials in Beijing have repeatedly stated that Tokyo started all the troubles and must accept full blame. Now, analysts in Beijing claim that a \"Pandora's Box\" has been opened, and there is no going back to the tacit agreement that has kept peace in the East China Sea for decades. Similar heavy-handed action was used against the Philippines in a spat over the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea in April 2012. When Manila maladroitly responded to a fishing run-in by sending a warship, China took the opportunity to strengthen its claim over the disputed shoal by deploying law enforcement vessels to the area, extending its annual unilateral fishing ban to cover the waters around the shoal; quarantining tropical fruit imports from the Philippines and suspending tourism; and roping off the mouth of the lagoon to keep out other fishermen. By maintaining regular law enforcement patrols and preventing Filipino fishermen from entering those waters, China has managed to establish a new status quo in its favor. A similar blueprint was then used in response to a maritime law passed by Vietnam in June 2012 that covered the disputed Spratley and Paracel Islands. Before the ink on the law had dried, China upgraded the administrative status of Sansha City, encompassing a group of disputed islands in the South China Sea, and established a military garrison. The development of Sansha City has continued apace. Following the central government's provision of 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) for the construction of the city, Sansha officials are said to be considering plans to build more ports, open casinos and create an offshore tax haven. By all accounts, new leader Xi Jinping has played a key role in crafting China's response in its maritime disputes and was central to Beijing's response to Japan's island purchase announcement. He was put in charge of a maritime security leading group in mid-2012, then the \"Office to Respond to the Diaoyu Crisis\" in September. After taking control of both the communist party and the military in November, his rhetoric essentially formalized the reactive assertive tactic by repeating the importance of \"peaceful development\" while pledging zero tolerance for those who would harm China's \"sovereignty, security or development interests.\" That is not to say that Beijing is necessarily looking for external troubles, as it remains preoccupied with maintaining the momentum of economic development and preventing domestic problems from erupting into potentially destabilizing unrest. But unfortunately, there is little appetite in Beijing for blunting the edge of China's \"reactively assertive\" foreign policy. If anything, opinions are going the other way. As Fu Ying, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, put it: When facing provocations, the Chinese public \"hopes that China will be even more assertive.\" If there is any perceived slight, no matter how minor, expect China to pounce. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt.", "reference": "China has warned it will respond \"decisively\" to provocations on territorial disputes .\nThere are signs Beijing will stick to its policy of \"reactive assertiveness\"\nChina's leaders are meeting at the National People's Congress in Beijing .\nXi Jinping is expected to formally assume China's presidency ."}

The crypt, which was found containing seven naturally mummified bodies, was excavated in a monastery at Old Dongola - the capital of a lost medieval kingdom that flourished in the Nile Valley. One of the mummies is thought to be that of Archbishop Georgios, an extremely powerful religious leader in the ancient Makuria kingdom. The 900-year-old crypt (entranceway shown) uncovered in Old Dongola in modern-day Sudan contains seven mummified bodies and walls covered with inscriptions written in Greek and Sahidic Coptic . The inscriptions on the walls of the crypt were written with black ink on a layer of whitewash and have been identified as Greek and Sahidic Coptic. Excerpts from the gospels of Luke, John, Mark and Matthew, as well as magical names and signs, were found on the walls. A prayer given by the Virgin Mary, at the end of which death appears to her ‘in the form of a rooster’ was also uncovered. The crypt was excavated in a monastery at Old Dongola, the capital of a lost medieval kingdom that flourished in the Nile Valley . Old Dongola was first the capital of Makuria and subsequently that of Makuria-Nobatia. At the time the crypt was created, Makuria was at its height. Its kings, ruling from Old Dongola, controlled territory throughout much of modern-day Sudan and parts of southern Egypt. The kingdom was prosperous between 750 and 1150. However, increased hostility from Egypt, and internal discord led to the state's collapse in the 14th century. One of the mummies is thought to be that of Archbishop Georgios, an extremely powerful religious leader in the ancient Makuria kingdom. Researchers believe the inscriptions served as protection for the deceased against evil powers. They were ‘intended to safeguard not only the tomb, but primarily those who were buried inside of it during the dangerous liminal period between the moment of dying and their appearance before the throne of God,’ wrote Adam Lajtar of the University of Warsaw, in the journal Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean. According to the researchers, Archbishop Georgios’ epitaph was found nearby, stating that he died in A.D. 1113 at the age of 82. They believe one of the mummified bodies within the crypt is of the religious leader. The other mummies within the crypt were of men all over 40 years of age, said anthropologist Robert Mahler. They were all dressed very simply in linen clothing and the crypt was likely sealed after the last of the burials took place. At the time the crypt was created, Makuria was at its height. Its kings, ruling from Old Dongola, controlled territory throughout much of modern-day Sudan and parts of southern Egypt.

The solar business is now a $6 billion industry, up 300% from 2006, said officials with the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with solar energy industry. With 100,237 jobs as of August, solar employers expect their workforce to grow 24% next year, according to the foundation's National Solar Jobs Census 2011, completed in partnership with BW Research Partnership's Green LMI Consulting division and Cornell University. \"It's great news,\" said Andrea Luecke, executive director of the Solar Foundation. \"Despite a struggling economy and the worst recession since the Depression and despite the Solyndra debacle, the industry is experiencing record-breaking trade numbers, record-breaking installed capacity, and record-breaking private investment.\" Solyndra Inc. was once considered a model \"green\" company producing state-of-the-art solar panels, but it is now at the center of congressional scrutiny and a FBI probe after the Fremont, California, firm filed for bankruptcy in late August and put more than 1,000 people out of work, even though it received $535 million in federal loan guarantees. The bankruptcy leaves the government unlikely to get back the money it loaned. President Barack Obama touted the company in a visit last year. Despite the controversy, the solar sector appears bullish, Luecke said. \"Solyndra, of course, is just one company, and they went out of business because they could no longer compete with not only Chinese manufactures but also U.S. manufacturers,\" Luecke said. \"There's nothing to indicate that the solar industry is not poised for growth, though we do need smart policy investment as all energies do,\" Luecke added. She was referring to state and federal legislation that would give \"employers the confidence they need to expand their workforce,\" she said. California continued to be the national leader in solar employment, with 25,575 workers. Other states in the top 10 are Colorado, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Texas, Oregon, New Jersey and Massachusetts, the group said. The study identified 17,198 solar employments sites in the United States. The survey collected data from more than 2,100 companies. \"The National Solar Jobs Census is an important reference because the previous lack of data about solar employment was presenting difficulties to policymakers and training providers,\" Philip Jordan, chief business officer at BW Research Partnership, said in a statement. Added John Bunge, associate professor in the department of statistical science at Cornell University's School of Industrial Labor Relations: \"The jobs census is setting a new standard for clean energy job studies. \"The use of both primary and secondary data sources, along with careful statistical analysis, gives us high confidence in the results.

{"id": 15144, "article": "A British scientist fathered up to 600 children after founding a fertility clinic that promised to provide sperm donors from ‘intelligent stock’, it emerged yesterday. Biologist Bertold Wiesner supplied sperm to the partners of infertile men from the middle and upper classes, including ‘peers of the realm’. His wife Mary Barton later destroyed medical records, meaning most of those conceived there – and their thousands of subsequent offspring – have no idea of their true family history and blood ties. Family ties: Barry Stevens with a photograph of his father Bertold Wiesner . Half-brothers: Barry Stevens from Canada, left, and David Gollancz from London, right, were both conceived at the controversial Barton clinic and have discovered that Bertold Wiesner is their biological father . But two men conceived by artificial . insemination at the practice, which operated from the early 1940s until . the mid-1960s, have completed research suggesting up to two-thirds of . sperm donations during that period were by Wiesner. David Gollancz, one of Wiesner’s . biological sons, estimated he would have made 20 donations a year, . meaning he is likely to have fathered between 300 and 600 children. The barrister found out in 1965, at . the age of 12, that he was born from a sperm donor, but was never told . who his biological father was. He finally discovered the truth . through DNA tests and has subsequently made contact with 11 of his . half-siblings, including documentary-maker Barry Stevens, who led . research into the clinic. Mr Gollancz said he had mixed feelings about . his unusual family history. Donor: It is believed that Bertold Wiesner may have fathered up to 600 children through donating sperm at the fertility clinic he founded with his wife Mary Barton in the 1940s . He said: ‘It’s rather uncomfortable, . because artificial insemination was developed on an industrial scale for . cattle and I don’t like the feeling of having been “bred”. ‘But meeting the half siblings that I . have tracked down has been a very life-enriching experience. This does . make it frustrating too, because I know there are all those other . siblings out there who I don’t know but would really like to meet. I’d . love to be able to hire a huge marquee and invite them all to a party.’ Wiesner and Barton’s clinic, based in . London’s Portland Place, is believed to have helped women conceive . around 1,500 babies known as the ‘Barton Brood’. Trent Arsenault, 36, hit the headlines last December after revealing he had fathered 14 children despite being a virgin by donating his sperm to reproductively challenged couples. Mr Arsenault, from Silicon Valley, California, set up a free online sperm bank to help childless couples in situations where he claimed the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger. Speaking on Anderson Cooper's daytime show, he said: '100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that. 'I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin, except I'll have 15 plus kids.' He told Huffington Post: ‘I'm helping people in need... I'm not running a business here.' The high fees meant most of their clients were middle-class, but Barton also claimed to have helped many of the upper classes and even some ‘peers of the realm’. The couple used family friends to provide sperm, but a shortage of donors is believed to have led to Wiesner providing the majority. DNA tests were carried out in 2007 on 18 people conceived at the clinic between 1943 and 1962. The tests found that 12 of the group – two-thirds – were Wiesner’s children. Dr Barton told a 1959 government forum on artificial insemination: ‘I matched race, colouring and stature and all donors were drawn from intelligent stock.’ She added: ‘I wouldn’t take a donor unless he was, if anything, a little above average. ‘If you are going to do it [create a child] deliberately, you have got to put the standards rather higher than normal.’ An article the couple wrote in 1945 about their work prompted a peer to denounce their activities in the House of Lords as ‘the work  of Beelzebub’. Geoffrey Fisher, then Archbishop of Canterbury, also demanded the closure of the clinic. Austrian-born Wiesner died in 1972, aged 70. His wife died 11 years ago. Mr Gollancz was involved in a campaign to stop sperm donors being anonymous, but said he still wanted further changes in the law. He said: ‘I would like to see birth certificates also carrying the name of the sperm or egg donor. ‘Most recipient parents don’t tell their children they are conceived this way, meaning they would never know to search for a donor father. ‘People have a right to know about their own history.’", "reference": "Bertold Wiesner set up the controversial London Barton clinic with his wife Mary Bartons in the 1940s .\nOnly select members of the couple's friends were chosen as donors to help women conceive 1,500 babies .\nTwo biological sons have found 18 others conceived at clinic -  12 were fathered by Dr Wiesner ."}

{"id": 15146, "article": "(CNN) -- Chelsea's big spending on Europe's transfer deadline day has been criticized by one of the club's English rivals, who questioned how the Premier League champions can meet UEFA's new financial fair-play rules. The London team announced a loss of $113 million on Monday for the year ended June 30, 2010 -- but then smashed the British transfer record with a reported $80 million acquisition of Spain striker Fernando Torres, and also laid out $34 million for Brazil defender David Luiz. The Torres deal allowed his former club Liverpool to spend $55 million on Newcastle's relatively unproven England striker Andy Carroll, who is injured, and $36 million on Uruguay forward Luis Suarez. However, European football's governing body UEFA will take sanctions against clubs who cannot balance their books by the end of the 2012 reporting period. The best and worst deals of a dramatic deadline day . Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal were again quiet in the January transfer window, and manager Arsene Wenger questioned the tactics of the Blues' billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich. \"Chelsea supported UEFA's financial fair-play proposals but in the morning they announced a £70 million loss and in the afternoon they buy £75 million worth of players. Where's the logic in that?\" he told reporters after Tuesday's 2-1 Premier League win over Everton. \"It's hard to guess. Officially they vote for financial fair play, but they can explain why they have done this much better than I can. Abramovich can tell you why, but that's how you can read it from the outside. \"If you don't invest for a while, it looks as if you're not as involved in it anymore, that he doesn't like it as much. But £75 million means more will come. \"Abramovich was a bit in no-man's land where nobody could guess if he wanted to still invest or not. He has been like that for a long time, but that has changed. He has decided to put big money in again and that tells you in the summer more will come. He is back to full investment.\" Adriano Galliani, vice-president of Italian club AC Milan, also criticized the level of spending in England -- which reached a record $363 million. \"Everyone's talking about balancing the books but then they spend like crazy people,\" he told reporters. \"Chelsea strengthened in an amazing way, spending 80 million euros. I just don't know where financial sense will end up.\" Chelsea sign Torres and Luiz in frantic end to deadline day . Chelsea dressed up the club's financial results by saying they were \"cash positive\" with a net inflow of £3.8 million compared to an outflow of £16.9 million in 2008-09. \"The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA 'financial fair play' initiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013,\" chief executive Ron Gourlay told the Chelsea website. UEFA released a statement saying that clubs \"are increasingly aware of the nature of the financial fair-play rules, which aim to encourage clubs to balance their incomes and expenses over a period of time covering four to six transfer windows.\" It refused to comment on individual clubs, but said the rules did not stop them from spending money on transfers as such -- the emphasis is on balancing books at the end of the season. \"There is no doubt that transfers made now will impact on the break-even results of the financial years ending 2012 and 2013 -- the first financial years to be assessed under the break-even rule,\" UEFA said. \"The clubs know the rules and also know that UEFA is fully committed to implementing them with rigor. As from this summer, all payments due on transfers and to employees will be assessed by the Club Financial Control Panel as part of the 'enhanced overdue payables' rule.\"", "reference": "Arsenal manager unhappy with Chelsea's $114 million outlay on two players .\nArsene Wenger says spending shows no logic after announcing a massive loss .\nAC Milan official also criticizes England's record level of January outlay .\nEuropean clubs must balance their books by end of 2012 or face sanctions ."}

Shi Le Zhang, 42, who ran 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield, pleaded guilty to four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates’ Court. Magistrates heard how rat droppings were found in the takeaway and food preparation areas - which included the outside back yard - were filthy. Magistrates heard how rats were found in the takeaway and food preparation areas were extremely dirty (above). Investigators also heard freezer temperatures were not at the right level and food was left exposed . Shi Le Zhang, 42, pleaded guilty to four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates' Court after the prosecution told how 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield had a rat infestation . The court was told that standards of the takeaway – which currently has a zero rating for hygiene - slipped after its chefs left the country for the Chinese New Year celebrations. Miles Barker, prosecuting on behalf of Kirklees Council, said that the town centre premises had been known to the Environmental Health service since at least 2006. He explained that the business had never scored more than a two out of five in the Food Standards Agency’s scores on doors ratings. On the evening of January 29 the council’s officers went to the takeaway and found that food was being stored and prepared outside in the rear yard. Mr Barker said: ‘It has a known rat infestation which is not uncommon in Huddersfield now due to the ageing of the properties. ‘The rats appear to thrive on access to rubbish from businesses around there.’ Investigators found that food was being prepared and stored in an outside yard to the rear of 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield (above), which is described as a 'prominent and popular' takeaway in the town centre area . The court was told that standards at 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield town centre - which currently has a zero rating for hygiene - slipped after its chefs left the country for the Chinese New Year celebrations . Magistrates heard that part of this area was sectioned off with a wall, gates and a corrugated roof. Mr Barker said: ‘It was clear that food was being stored and prepared there. ‘A metal table had a bucket of chopped pork and two buckets of vegetables. ‘There was food debris and peelings in a tray and fridge freezers and shelves. ‘There was evidence of rat activity outside and rat droppings were found in various locations.’ Mr Barker said that there was evidence of smoking in this area and it was an offence to smoke in a food preparation area. There was also no hot water in the kitchen hand wash basin and dishcloths where food was being prepared were so dirty that they had to be thrown away. Plastic boxes of cooked rice sat at 210C and large amounts of other food had been left out at room temperature, providing a breeding ground for bacteria. The freezer was not running at the correct temperature and food including fried eggs were left uncovered on shelves. Mr Barker added: ‘Raw meat was defrosting in washing up bowls not designated as raw meat only. Due to his limited means magistrates ordered Zhang to pay £150 fine as well as £500 prosecution costs . The court heard how there was no hot water in the kitchen hand wash basin and dishcloths where food was being prepared were so dirty that they had to be thrown away . ‘Filters were missing from an extraction canopy so there was no way of removing moisture and grease from the air. ‘This attracts dirt and germs and also presents a fire safety hazard. ‘It wasn’t being cleaned frequently enough and the officers were very disappointed in what they found.’ Zhang, who said he is now just a chef at the takeaway, closed it down immediately and had it cleaned. With the aid of a Mandarin interpreter, he told the court: ‘It was the Chinese New Year and some of the chefs went back to China. ‘Other part time staff tried to cover and for a month made a mess of it.’ Magistrates told him they were concerned about the public safety of the business, which they described as prominent and popular with students.

It’s the time of year when we traditionally hit the shops in search of  the perfect Christmas gifts. But this festive season, it seems most of us will be buying presents on our laptops or smartphones instead. Britain leads the world in online Christmas shopping, a survey has found, with nearly nine in ten of us planning to buy some of our gifts on the internet this year. Going online: The study by PayPal found many customers were buying their gifts in the internet to long queues and check-outs . And our main reason for turning to the web is a desire to avoid long queues at the check-outs. The study, by PayPal, found 88 per cent of shoppers in Britain will log on for Christmas purchases, compared with 86 per cent in the US and 84 per cent in Germany. The UK was also ahead of Australia, Canada, France and Italy. Forty eight per cent of Britons said they would be doing all their gift shopping online, ahead of Americans (42 per cent) and Germans (41 per cent). The study found nearly one in three had turned to the internet mainly in order to avoid check-out queues. The rise of web shopping has dealt a serious blow to traditional high streets, with thousands of shops now boarded up across the UK. Some estimates suggest more than 30million people – more . than half the population – will be browsing for gifts over this weekend. Sales on ‘Cyber Monday’ are predicted to be up by 16per cent . on the equivalent day last year, making it the busiest web shopping day ever.

{"id": 15150, "article": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Clarence Thomas has an abundance of two things that are often in short supply whenever Americans talk about race: courage and common sense. The only African-American on the Supreme Court displayed both this week in speaking to a small gathering of students and faculty at Palm Beach Atlantic University, a nondenominational Christian school in Florida. In a series of provocative and insightful comments about race that were first reported by Yahoo! News and confirmed by several people who attended the talk and heard the remarks firsthand, Thomas dropped a few bombshells. This got people's attention because -- nearly 25 years after his bitter confirmation battle -- Thomas remains a lightning rod for controversy, and because he rarely speaks while on the bench. Apparently, he has been saving the best stuff for the public remarks that he delivers in more casual settings. Like this one: . \"My sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school,\" Thomas told the audience. \"To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white (Catholic) school. Rarely did the issue of race come up.\" He went on to note that, these days, many Americans talk about race a lot and have a hair trigger on the subject. \"Now, name a day (race) doesn't come up,\" Thomas said. \"Differences in race, differences in sex, somebody doesn't look at you right, somebody says something. Everybody is sensitive.\" The sensitive include Samuel L. Jackson. In a cringe-inducing confrontation, Jackson scolded an entertainment reporter at a Los Angeles television station after the journalist, in asking about a Super Bowl commercial, appeared to confuse Jackson for another African-American actor -- Laurence Fishburne. Both actors had appeared in Super Bowl commercials, and the reporter seemed to get them mixed up. \"You're as crazy as the people on Twitter. I'm not Laurence Fishburne!\" Jackson said during a live TV interview with KTLA's Sam Rubin. \"We don't all look alike. We may be all black and famous, but we all don't look alike. You're busted.\" Rubin immediately apologized for the mistake, but Jackson kept razzing him. It was overkill. \"I'm the other guy,\" the actor said. \"There's more than one black guy doing a commercial. I'm the 'What's in your wallet?' black guy. He's the car black guy. Morgan Freeman is the other credit card black guy. You only hear his voice, though, so you probably won't confuse him with Laurence Fishburne.\" It seemed to be all in good fun, but it was still hard to watch. Rubin made a mistake. But it looked like Jackson was the one with the problem. Rubin did have some defenders. They include CNN's Don Lemon, who -- after a contentious exchange between guests on a show he was hosting -- seemed to agree with Thomas that \"people are really sensitive when it comes to race.\" Finally, Thomas took aim at a group that often gets a pass for its mistreatment of minorities that it claims to be helping. \"The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites,\" he said. \"The absolute worst I have ever been treated, the worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, are by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.\" Only Thomas can speak to how he has been treated in his life, and who treated him worse. That is a personal matter. As one of the most conservative members of the High Court, he obviously has little respect for liberals. And the feeling is entirely mutual. And yet, we can expect Thomas' observation about \"northern liberal elites\" to resonate with many other African-Americans and Latinos who have been criticized, attacked, or disparaged by this bunch for veering off the script of how minorities are supposed to think, speak and behave. Those minorities are often treated as defective in some way and certainly not representative of their respective communities. They're an aberration, an anomaly, a mistake. Make no mistake. The friction here isn't about politics. It's about something more primal: control. Liberals wanted to give people like Clarence Thomas every right except, it turns out, the right to think for themselves. If you forget that, you'll be labeled a \"sellout,\" a \"traitor,\" a \"right wingnut\" or worse. Most Americans probably look back on Thomas' confirmation hearings in the fall of 1991, and think that what made them so messy were those unseemly accusations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill. That was a sideshow. The real reason for the tension in those hearings was that Thomas represents something liberals can't stand: a black conservative. Those on the left see conservatives of color as a kind of sociological experiment gone bad -- these are people who are ungrateful for the many opportunities they were provided by the liberal establishment which, in return, asked for only three things: undying loyalty, constant agreement, and lifelong subservience. Thomas doesn't play that game. He never has. And that's why he is always at the center of the storm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.", "reference": "Clarence Thomas said America may be too sensitive about race today .\nRuben Navarrette says Thomas displays courage and common sense .\nHe says the justice is right in saying Northern liberal elites are less tolerant of differing views .\nNavarrette: Those on the left don't view conservatives of color as legitimate ."}
{"id": 15151, "article": "London (CNN) -- The jury in the phone hacking trial of former newspaper editor and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson has been discharged after it could not reach a verdict on the final charges in the case, a court official said Wednesday. Former News of the World editor Coulson was convicted Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006. But the jury was not able to reach a decision Wednesday on two charges each of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office against Coulson and the paper's former royal editor, Clive Goodman. The court said that a decision on a retrial for these charges would be made Monday. Another of Rupert Murdoch's former newspaper chiefs, Rebekah Brooks, was unanimously cleared of all charges Tuesday after the eight-month trial at the Old Bailey court. Shortly before the jury was discharged, the judge in the case, John Saunders, issued an unusual rebuke to Prime Minister David Cameron and \"a large number of politicians from all parties\" for commenting on the case after the partial verdicts Tuesday. \"I consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of law are concerned,\" Saunders said in his ruling. \"The press in court have been extremely responsible in their reporting of this case but when politicians regard it as open season, one cannot expect the press to remain silent.\" The ruling followed an application for the jury to be discharged on the basis that it was no longer possible for Coulson and Goodman to have a fair trial because of those comments. But the judge said he had decided not to discharge the jury on those grounds. \"I am satisfied that the jury will continue to try Mr. Coulson and Mr. Goodman on the evidence that they have heard in court and solely on that evidence,\" he said. A spokesman for the Prime Minister's office said that Cameron had taken the \"best legal advice\" before giving a statement Tuesday. Cameron: 'Wrong decision' Speaking before the House of Commons on Wednesday, Cameron repeated the apology he'd made a day earlier for hiring Coulson as his director of communications in 2007. \"I am sorry, this was the wrong decision, but I think it's right that we've had a public inquiry in this country, and it's right that we have proper investigations,\" he said. \"Yesterday once again showed that no one is above the law in our country.\" Public and political outrage over the hacking revelations led to the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World paper and the setting up of a public inquiry to examine journalistic ethics, known as the Leveson Inquiry, as well as a police investigation. In a statement Wednesday, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner who oversaw the investigation, said it had been \"complex and challenging\" -- and that officers involved had been aware of the \"sensitivities\" of investigating a national newspaper and confidential journalistic material. \"This investigation has never been about an attack on press freedom but one to establish whether any criminal offenses had been committed, to establish who was responsible for committing them and to bring them to justice. The victims deserved no less,\" she said. \"Along with the verdicts, I hope this will give some comfort to the many victims that justice has been served.\" The Metropolitan Police investigation into phone hacking, which was launched in January 2011 and dubbed Operation Weeting, identified 5,500 victims. Of those, 3,500 have been contacted, a police statement said. The investigation involved sifting through millions of e-mails, tens of thousands of documents, other data communications and financial transactions, it said. Murdered schoolgirl . Tuesday's verdicts came three years after it was revealed that journalists on News of the World hacked the voice mail of then-missing teenager Milly Dowler in 2002, raising hopes that she was alive and checking messages, when in fact she had been murdered. At the time the schoolgirl's voice mail was intercepted, Brooks was editor of Britain's top-selling News of the World, and Coulson was her deputy. After Coulson succeeded her as editor, Brooks edited The Sun newspaper, and she later became chief executive of the parent company, News International -- now known as News UK. Coulson resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 after its then-royal editor, Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for hacking into voice-mail messages left for royal aides. Coulson denied any wrongdoing and later became Cameron's director of communications. The former editor resigned from his Downing Street position in 2011 as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened. 'Wrongdoing occurred' Besides a charge of conspiracy to hack voice mails, Brooks also was accused of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, as was her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter. All three were cleared of those charges, the Press Association reported, as was former News International head of security Mark Hanna. Retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner was cleared of conspiracy to hack phones. Five people pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges before the case came to trial, the police said. They were Mulcaire, Neville Thurlbeck, Greg Miskiw, James Weatherup and Daniel Evans. News UK, the UK newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch's News Corp., said in a statement: \"We said long ago, and repeat today, that wrongdoing occurred, and we apologized for it. We have been paying compensation to those affected and have cooperated with investigations.\" The publisher said it was making changes to ensure this kind of wrongdoing did not recur and that it supported a new UK press watchdog expected to start work later this year.

{"id": 15152, "article": "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday tried to douse a political firestorm over the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, saying she's responsible for the security of American diplomatic outposts. \"I take responsibility,\" Clinton told CNN in an interview while on a visit to Peru. \"I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.\" But she said an investigation now under way will ultimately determine what happened at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11. \"I take this very personally,\" Clinton said. \"So we're going to get to the bottom of it, and then we're going to do everything we can to work to prevent it from happening again, and then we're going to work to bring whoever did this to us to justice.\" VP debate left unanswered national security questions . The attack took place in the eastern Libyan city that was the cradle of that country's 2011 revolution. Obama administration officials initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. With criticism growing, Vice President Joe Biden said during last week's vice presidential debate that the White House did not know of requests to enhance security at Benghazi, contradicting testimony by State Department employees that requests had been made and rejected. After the debate, the White House said the vice president did not know of the requests because they were handled, as is the practice, by the State Department. Fact Check: Benghazi security . \"In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion,\" Clinton said. \"And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens.\" She added, \"What I want to avoid is some kind of political gotcha or blame game.\" \"I know that we're very close to an election,\" Clinton said. \"I want to just take a step back here and say from my own experience, we are at our best as Americans when we pull together. I've done that with Democratic presidents and Republican presidents.\" Her remarks drew a quick response from three Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, including ranking member John McCain. Clinton's statement of responsibility was \"a laudable gesture, especially when the White House is trying to avoid any responsibility whatsoever,\" the Arizona senator said in a joint broadside with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. However, they added, \"The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the commander-in-chief. The buck stops there.\" Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died in the Benghazi assault, which State Department officials now say was the work of dozens of armed men. Clinton also described a desperate scene in the State Department during the hours of the attack, as staff tried to find out what had happened. \"This was a many-hour ordeal that we were all involved in, and I was deeply concerned as you would obviously assume, to hear about an attack,\" she said. Not only was the picture coming out of Libya murky, but also, \"Then we couldn't find Ambassador Stevens, and we were trying desperately to figure out what happened to him and to Sean Smith and to the others who were there.\" Actress sues filmmaker . Clinton said her mission now is to make sure such an attack will never happen again, and also to ensure the work of American diplomats won't be stopped even in dangerous areas like Benghazi. \"We can't retreat.

{"id": 15153, "article": "(CNN) -- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world, the average American is probably asking, \"How should I protect myself?\" U.S. health officials stress the importance of frequent hand washing during outbreaks of illness. Health officials' advice is to follow common-sense precautions: Wash your hands, stay home if you're sick and listen to your local health authorities. \"Very frequent hand-washing is something that we talk about time and time again and that is an effective way to reduce transmission of disease,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"If you're sick, it's very important that people stay at home. If your children are sick, have a fever and flu-like illness, they shouldn't go to school. And if you're ill, you shouldn't get on an airplane or another public transport to travel. Those things are part of personal responsibility in trying to reduce the impact. \" So far, Mexico has been hardest hit by swine flu. Cases have been confirmed in the United States, as well as countries including Canada, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and Israel. \"In areas with no disease yet, a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the CDC's Science and Public Health Program. In addition to washing hands often, she recommends covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoiding touching your eyes and nose in case the virus is on your hands. The World Health Organization calls the situation a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" and the United States has declared a \"public health emergency,\" likened by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to preparations for a potential hurricane. No authorities are calling the outbreak a pandemic. The CDC expects U.S. numbers will grow and recommendations will change depending on what happens in individual communities, said the CDC's Schuchat. The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school, work and public events. Because so much is still unknown at this point, the main risk factor is people traveling to areas where cases have already been identified. \"However this virus may already be in other places in the United States,\" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN. \"With enhanced surveillance, we will see more cases and that is why it makes good sense to be proactive, by doing things we know are effective in reducing exposure.\"  Explainer: Swine flu facts » . Schuchat noted swine flu symptoms are relatively general and nonspecific. \"So many different things can cause these symptoms. it is a dilemma,\" she said. \"It is a challenge that we are wrestling with. There is not a perfect test right now to let a person or doctor know exactly what this is.\" But Schuchat specifically advised anyone who feels ill after returning from Mexico to see a doctor. Unfortunately, since this is a new strain of influenza, the flu vaccine for this past flu season offers no protection. \"However, we do have anti-virals that work against this swine flu,\" said Skinner, referring to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). \"Someone who has [swine flu], if they are treated early, the anti-flu medicines work against this.\" According to Skinner, health officials are still trying to figure out where exactly the virus originated, how transmissible it is and why it is mild in some cases and deadlier in others.

Quit: Cardinal Keith O'Brien has resigned as Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh . Britain's most senior Roman Catholic yesterday apologised for his failures after being ordered to quit by the Pope as a further sex scandal swept the church. Cardinal Keith O’Brien said sorry as it was revealed that he must resign now rather than wait until his 75th birthday, which falls next month. In a statement the Cardinal, 74, said: ‘Looking back over my years of ministry: for any good I have been able to do, I thank God. For any failures, I apologise to all whom I have offended.’ The Vatican instruction follows allegations made by three un-named priests and one former priest who say that they were subjected to ‘inappropriate’ approaches by the cardinal 30 years ago. The complaints were made to the Vatican’s representative in London early last month – before Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation, but after Cardinal O’Brien had made known to Rome that he wished to resign ‘in view of his 75th birthday’. The sudden departure of the cardinal leaves the church grappling with the implications of a new sex scandal affecting its senior leadership and denies British Roman Catholics any influence on the voting when 116 cardinals gather to elect Benedict’s replacement next month. The affair intensified the sense of intrigue and conspiracy that has grown around the Papacy since Benedict made the surprise announcement of his own decision to quit on February 11. The dramatic move to become the first Pope in 600 years to resign has provoked intense speculation both on what influences may have been at work on Benedict and on what role he will play after he stands down. A Vatican adviser in Scotland said the O’Brien resignation was ‘shocking and sad’ but ‘unsurprising’. Cardinal O’Brien’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks. The vehemence of his public stand against same-sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby. Scroll down for video . Staying away: Cardinal O'Brien, pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh and the Pope, will no longer attend the election to choose Benedict XVI's successor . However, in a surprise move just a day . before the sex scandal broke, he upset traditionalists by calling for . priests to be given the right to marry. His immediate departure was set out in an announcement from the Scottish church yesterday morning. Cardinal O’Brien said: ‘Approaching . the age of 75 and at times in indifferent health, I tendered my . resignation as Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh to Pope . Benedict XVI some months ago.’ He added that he had been ‘happy to . know’ that on November 13 last year the Pope had accepted his . resignation, but that it would take effect at an unspecified later date. Position: The archbishop was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and the UK's senior priest . Senior church figures are expected to . go at 75, but the Vatican often allows leeway of a year or two. Following news of the sex scandal over the weekend, the Pope gave . Cardinal O’Brien no choice. ‘The Holy Father has now decided that . my resignation will take effect today, 25 February 2013, and that he . will appoint an Apostolic Administrator to govern the Archdiocese in my . place until my successor is appointed,’ Cardinal O’Brien said. The decision means he will no longer . travel to Rome as planned to take part in the conclave that will elect . the next Pope in March. The Cardinal said in his statement: ‘I . thank Pope Benedict XVI for his kindness and courtesy to me and…I wish . him a long and happy retirement. ‘I also ask God’s blessing on my . brother Cardinals who will soon gather in Rome to elect his successor. I . will not join them for this conclave. I do not wish media attention in . Rome to be focused on me – but rather on Pope Benedict XVI and on his . successor.’ Saying mass in Edinburgh: Cardinal Keith O' Brien in his role as Britain's most senior Catholic . Cardinal O’Brien, who on Sunday missed . a mass in St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh that had been intended to . celebrate eight years of Benedict’s papacy, has contested claims of . inappropriate behaviour made against him. The claims were made to the Papal . Nuncio, the Vatican ambassador in London, Antonio Mennini, in the week . before the announcement of Benedict’s resignation on February 11. According to the Observer newspaper, . one former priest claims Cardinal O’Brien made an inappropriate approach . to him in 1980, after night prayers, when he was a seminarian at St . Andrew’s College, Drygrange. The man, who is now married, says he . resigned as a priest when Cardinal O’Brien was first made a bishop. He . said in his complaint: ‘I knew then he would always have power over me. It was assumed I left the priesthood to get married. I did not. I left . to preserve my integrity.’ In Rome: The cardinal had been due to travel to the Vatican to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave . A second statement from another priest . says he was living in a parish when he was visited by Cardinal O’Brien, . and inappropriate contact took place between them. A third man said he had had to deal with ‘unwanted behaviour’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after some late-night drinking. The fourth complaint came from a priest who said the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact. Retiring: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his blessing during his last Angelus noon prayer from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the Vatican yesterday . A Vatican adviser in Scotland, . Professor John Haldane of St Andrews University, said: ‘The resignation . of Cardinal O’Brien as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, within a . month of the date on which his formal resignation would normally have . taken effect is both shocking and sad. ‘Given the nature of the accusations, . however, and the publication of them over the weekend, ahead of the . formal abdication of Pope Benedict later in the week, it is unsurprising . that he has taken the decision to resign.’ Professor Haldane, added: ‘The . Cardinal could not but be mindful of the problems that would follow . given the inevitable press interest created by the accusations, and he . would not want that burden to fall upon the Church and the Pope at what . is obviously a critical moment in the life of the Roman Catholic . community.' The departure of the Cardinal leaves the five million faithful in Britain without a representative when the new Pope is chosen. It will mean that the number of cardinals with the power to vote in the conclave for Benedict’s successor is reduced to 116, with at least one other withdrawal a possibility between now and the opening of discussions in the Vatican next month. There are some 750,000 Catholics  in Scotland who would have been represented by the Cardinal as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh. More than four million Catholics in England and Wales have no voice in the talks and no vote in the final reckoning because there is no qualified cardinal among their leaders. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, who stepped down as Archbishop of Westminster in 2009, is 80, and so too old to join the voting bloc of cardinals. He will, however, travel to Rome to take part in advisory talks. His successor as Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols, has yet to be awarded a cardinal’s hat more than three years after taking over as leader of Catholics in England and Wales. Some observers believe this is because Benedict has been suspicious of what he sees as liberal tendencies among English bishops. Another cardinal is under pressure to follow Keith O’Brien out of the conclave. Roger Mahony, former Archbishop of Los Angeles, who is being urged to step down by lobby groups who accuse him of covering up sex abuse by priests. The conclave may now begin around March 10. The Pope’s resignation takes effect on Thursday evening this week, 28 February.

About 16,500 people are isolated because of flooding in New South Wales, with evacuation orders in place for several communities, the New South Wales Emergency Services said. In the neighboring state of Queensland, authorities issued flood warnings for three towns, Surat, Roma and Mitchell, and warned residents living downstream of rivers to move to higher ground. Residents of the southwestern Queensland town of Charleville are hoping that its protective levees will hold back the rising waters. Emergency officials ordered evacuations early Saturday as they warned that the river was expected to top the levee banks within 12 hours. Food and medical supplies have been flown to isolated communities elsewhere in Queensland. In New South Wales, officials issued natural disaster declarations for several areas. Flood waters have started to recede around North Moree after five days of major flooding, the New South Wales Emergency Services said, but many of the town's streets remain closed. Aerial assessments show some 300 homes and businesses have been inundated -- making it the worst flooding in nearly 60 years, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported. The State Emergency Service carried out 18 flood rescues from Friday to Saturday, Seven Network reported, including half a dozen people stuck on a shed roof near Moree with snakes swimming underneath them. The airline Qantas put on a special flight to Moree on Saturday with supplies of fresh food and milk, the network added. Major flooding has also affected communities along the Namoi River, leading to the rescue of at least one person trapped in a vehicle on a flooded bridge. The town of Wee Waa is cut off, with all roads made impassable by flood water and the local airport also out of action, the New South Wales Emergency Services said. Major flooding is expected to continue there until the middle of next week. Other communities affected by the Namoi River include Boggoabri, Narrabri Bugilbone and Goangra, with flood waters closing roads and inundating some rural properties.. Emergency officials urged people not to walk, ride or drive through flood waters, as this is the main cause of death and injury during floods.", "reference": "Queensland and New South Wales are suffering major flooding .\nEmergency officials issue evacuation orders for many communities .\nSupplies are flown into some towns cut off by flooding .\nResidents are urged not to walk or drive through flood waters because of the injury risk ."}
{"id": 15156, "article": "(CNN) -- When Peggielene Bartels went to bed on a summer night in 2008, she was an ordinary administrative assistant living in a modest one-bedroom condo just outside Washington D.C. But a few hours later, when a persistent ringing phone woke her up in the dead of the August night, the 55-year-old found out she was much more than simply a secretary. At the other end of the line was Bartels's cousin, from Otuam, a small fishing village on the coast of Ghana. Excited and humble, he congratulated her on being the new king of Otuam. \"I said, 'listen, it's 4 o'clock in the morning in the U.S., I am very tired, let me sleep,'\" remembers Bartels. \"I thought he was trying to really play games with me.\" But this was no time for games. The previous king of Otuam, who was Bartels's uncle, had just died. The village elders, who remembered Bartels from the times she'd visited with her mother, had decided to anoint her as their new ruler. Watch video: King Peggy shows off her crowns . After the initial shock, Bartels decided to accept the kingship. Over the course of a few days, she went from being plain old Peggielene Bartels, who had worked for nearly three decades at the Ghanaian Embassy in the United States, to becoming King Peggy -- the first female king of Otuam, reigning over approximately 7,000 people. \"It never ever occurred to me [that I'd be Otuam's king],\" says Bartels, who's been living in the United States since her early 20s. \"I realized that on this earth, we all have a calling. We have to be ready to accept it because helping my people has really helped me a lot to know that I can really touch their lives,\" she adds. \"I would have really regretted it if I hadn't really accept this calling.\" Although she still works at the Ghanaian Embassy, Bartels uses all her holiday every year to spend a month in Otuam. King is the traditional title of Otuam's ruler, and Bartels says she's happy to be called a king, rather than queen, because it means she can achieve more. \"Most of the time, a king is the one who has all the executive power to do things, while the queen is mostly in charge of the children's affairs and reporting to the king,\" she says. \"So I really love this.\" Read more: The Lady King of Otuam . King Peggy was born in Takoradi, southern Ghana, in 1953. She studied in England before moving to the United States, where she became an American citizen in 1997. But after inheriting the throne, Bartels has been living two very different lives in two different continents. In Washington, her secretarial duties include typing letters, answering phone calls and booking appointments. In her little apartment her life is far removed from the luxuries of her royal roots. \"When I am in the United States I do everything by myself,\" she explains. \"I do my own laundry, I do my own cooking, I do my own driving and I do my own bed when I wake up in the morning.\" Read more: Secretary is still the top job for women . But back in Ghana, she stands out as a gold crown-wearing, scepter-holding king who lives in a refurbished palace. Otuam residents usually address her as \"Nana\" -- an honorary title given to royalty but also to women with grandchildren -- and bow when they see her. \"When I am back home they see me as their king and they want to pamper me,\" she says. \"They have to cook for me, they have to carry me around and they have to protect me from people. They want to do everything for me which I usually refuse ... Sometimes I say to them 'please, don't bow.' I just want them to be free and comfortable so that way we can really address issues.\" In pictures: Africa's power women . But beyond the bows, the royal attire and certain luxuries that come with her title, being a king in an impoverished place like Otuam is all about dealing with the pressing needs of the community and improving the lives of the people, says Bartels. \"To be a king in an African village or some places like this, it's not like European queens where everything is on a silver platter for them,\" she says. \"I have to really work hard to help my people. I have to give myself to people to better their lives.\" In the last few years, she's helped poor families pay school fees for their children and brought computers to classrooms. With the help of other Americans she's also provided Otuam with its first ambulance, as well as access to clean, running water. Her next priority, she says, is to bring state-of-the-art toilets to Otuam. And even when she's not in Ghana, her royal duties do not stop; she wakes up at 1am every morning to call Otuam and be informed about what's happening in the community. \"I talk to my regent, I talk to my elders,\" Bartels says. \"If there is something that I want to know, they tell me. If there is something that I want them to do, I tell them.\" Last year, King Peggy's real-life fairy tale was documented in a book written by her and author Eleanor Herman. And now she says her amazing life journey from secretary to king will be told in a film, after Hollywood star Will Smith bought the rights to the book. \"Next year, God willing, we are going to have a movie out there,\" says King Peggy. \"Queen Latifah is going to play me and I'm so happy to at least let the whole world know that a secretary can become a king and lead wisely and help the people.\"", "reference": "For more than 30 years, Peggielene Bartels has worked as a secretary in the U.S.\nBut then one day a phone call took her back to her Ghanaian roots .\nShe was chosen to be the king of Otuam, a fishing village in Ghana .\nHer life journey has been documented in a book; a Hollywood film is expected next year."}

The Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star had been heading to that area anyway, having left its home port of Seattle early last month to eventually break through sea ice and refuel the U.S. Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station on Ross Island. Now the icebreaker is retooling to help the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy and China's Xue Long due to \"sufficient concern that the vessels may not be able to free themselves from the ice,\" the Coast Guard said Saturday in a statement. The Polar Star, currently in Sydney, will take on supplies and head out Sunday on what should be a seven-day voyage to the ships in Commonwealth Bay, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. \"We are always ready and duty-bound to render assistance in one of the most remote and harsh environments on the face of the globe,\" said Vice Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific commander. Chinese ship in Antarctica rescue stuck in ice . The Australian agency formally requested the Americans help on Friday. The Coast Guard noted that the governments of Russia and China also asked for U.S. assistance. Earlier this week, a helicopter ferried 52 passengers from the MV Akadmik Shokalskiy to the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis. The Akadmik Shokalskiy had been trapped in unusually deep ice since Christmas Eve with scientists, journalists, tourists and crew members on board. Twenty-two Russian crew members are still on the Akademik Shokalskiy, waiting for either the ice to shift or for outside help. Xue Long is a Chinese icebreaker that sent out the helicopter Thursday that airlifted several dozen passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy to safety. But after that happened, the Chinese vessel itself got stuck in the ice, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Xue Long's captain told AMSA that his ship is safe, has plenty of food and supplies and did not need immediate assistance. The U.S. Coast Guard's \"only active heavy polar icebreaker,\" the 399-foot long Polar Star recently completed a three-year, $90 million overhaul. Capable of traveling at speeds of 18 knots (21 mph), the ship can continuously break through 6 feet of ice while traveling 3 knots. With its reinforced hull and special bow, the Polar Star can bust through as much as 21 feet of ice at a time.

{"id": 15159, "article": "The wife of a conman accused of pretending to be in a coma for two years to avoid court has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Helen Knight, 33, has been questioned by police investigating how her husband Alan, 48, claimed he was in a vegetative state and spent months saying he could not stand trial. Mr Knight was jailed for four-and-a-half years after he conned more than £40,000 out of his dementia sufferer neighbour Ivor Richards, 86, after the pensioner was taken into a care home. Arrested: Helen Knight and her husband Alan, pictured together, have been questioned by police over claims they perverted the course of justice by allegedly pretending he was in a coma to avoid his fraud trial . After he was arrested for fraud he said he suffered a massive neck injury, which he claimed had caused him to have seizures which left him in a comatose state. His wife allegedly told police and doctors how she cared for her often-unconscious husband after he broke his neck while pulling down a garage door. But police found footage of him going on shopping trips and holidays with his family, the court heard, and he was later jailed for his neighbour fraud. Jailed: Knight, who claims he broke his neck in his garage, is currently in prison but has been re-arrested and questioned by police . His wife Helen and Mr Knight, who is in prison, have now both been arrested by police investigating the coma con for allegedly perverting the course of justice. Both were released on bail and a file of evidence is expected to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in the next fortnight. A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'Police have arrested a 48-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman from the Swansea area on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and money laundering offences. 'The pair are currently on police bail while an investigation continues.' Father-of-three Knight's trial heard he apparently tried to beat justice claiming he was a quadriplegic - and was even hooked up to oxygen and had no movement from the neck down. Swansea Crown Court heard how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of the pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset. He was caught on CCTV at the Severn bridge toll on the M4 as he travelled back from the south coast, the court heard. Knight was also allegedly captured on CCTV in Tesco stores across the country after police traced the use of the family's loyalty club card. Allegations: Police claim that this CCTV was taken at a time when Knight claimed that he was in a 'vegetative state'. The couple are understood to deny this . Officers tried to 'at least twice' to bring him court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened. Swansea Crown Court was told he had 'pulled the wool' over his GP's eyes but he was unable to fool doctors at the hospital. While he was on 'observations' they spotted him eating, wiping his face and even writing. Knight eventually arrived in court in a wheelchair and neck brace. He admitted theft and forgery charges and was jailed for four and a half years in November last year. As he was sentenced, Judge Thomas told him: 'Aspects of this case in my experience are unique, and a strong message needs to be sent out to anyone who seeks to adopt similar tactics. 'Although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is nothing in like the condition he claims to be, and the conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non existent.' The judge also ordered an investigation into his medical condition after the case was delayed for months.

Didier Drogba celebrates his goal as Chelsea took a narrow advantage after their home tie against Juventus. Drogba, his season hampered by injury, suspension and a fallout with axed coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, looked back to his predatory best when he took a pass from Salomon Kalou and despatched the ball beyond Gianluigi Buffon in the 12th minute. Former Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri, now in charge of Juve, was given a warm reception by the home fans before the game. Ranieri is still held in high esteem by Chelsea supporters even though he failed to win a single trophy during his four-year stint at Stamford Bridge. Hiddink was taking charge of a Chelsea side at home for the first time since his temporary appointment and it was the hosts who made the first inroads towards goal with Jose Bosingwa forcing Buffon into a save with a left-foot shot from the edge of the area in the fourth minute. Four minutes later Drogba almost opened the scoring when he got ahead of his marker to turn a cross from Bosingwa just over the crossbar. But the Ivorian put the home side in front in the 12th minute when a superb through ball from Kalou provided him with a clear-cut shooting opportunity and Drogba supplied the required finish in style. It was the perfect start for the Premier League side although Juventus claimed Drogba was offside before he fired the ball home from 10 yards. In the 15th minute, Drogba should have made it two when he met a corner from Frank Lampard inside the six-yard box, but he inexplicably headed wide. Juventus enjoyed plenty of possession after the interval but found the Chelsea defense in fine form, with Petr Cech only having to deal with a succession of long-range efforts. Marco Marchionni and Alessandro del Piero both tried their luck from distance and Pavel Nedved went close near the end for the visitors. Chelsea also had chances to double their lead, notably when a 20-yard effort from Nicolas Anelka flashed inches wide, but Chelsea held on for the victory. \"We maybe should have scored a second goal to give us some breathing space for the second leg.

Members of Styx, REO Speedwagon and Journey in 2003. Styx and REO have teamed up for a song and tour. It started with classic rockers REO Speedwagon and Styx, with their \"Can't Stop Rockin' \" tour and single of the same name. Now Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire are getting on the bandwagon. The two horn-heavy bands have recorded three songs especially for their joint 30-city summer tour. It's part of a charity campaign to benefit food banks across the country -- \"Three Songs for Three Cans or Three Dollars.\" Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire team up on the new song \"You.\" The bands also take a stab at each other's material, with Chicago recording Earth, Wind & Fire's \"I Can't Let You Go\" and Earth, Wind & Fire covering Chicago's \"Wishing You Were Here.\" \"The fact that the artists and bands, in this case, are touring together builds excitement with the possibility of the live performance that is exclusive to the tour,\" said Bruce Burch of the University of Georgia's Music Business School. It's \"sort of a 'once in a lifetime' type of attraction that helps to sell concert tickets, merchandise and, hopefully, CDs and downloads.\" Concertgoers who contribute three cans of food or donate at least $3 will get a download card to access the tunes. People who don't make the shows will be able to donate online and download the songs at www.ewfandchicago.com. The Web site is expected to launch in early June. \"This is a dream come true,\" said Earth, Wind & Fire's Philip Bailey, who came up with the three-songs promotion. \"We want to invite everyone to help us do our small part to help feed America,\" added Chicago's trumpeter Lee Loughnane. Artists jamming together on stage is nothing new, and occasionally the songs are released as singles -- U2 and B.B. King's \"When Love Comes to Town,\" from the 1988 album and film \"Rattle and Hum,\" for example. Of course, duets promoting two hot artists or bands are hardly new either. Remember Josh Groban and Charlotte Church on \"The Prayer\" or \"Almost Paradise\" by Ann Wilson of Heart and Mike Reno of Loverboy from the \"Footloose\" soundtrack? \"Hip-hop artists have been using duets for some time to reach audiences of both artists,\" Burch said. In some cases, more than two artists collaborate. \"Even before that, country artists used this means to reach a larger audience for both artists,\" he said, noting the collaborations between George Jones and Tammy Wynette, and Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn. The new songs for the 2009 tours flip conventional wisdom. For decades, groups have recorded albums, then gone on tour to promote them. Specifically recording songs to promote a tour featuring a pairing of acts is a new idea -- and possibly one whose time has come, given the re-emergence of singles in the digital download age. Of course, it all depends on the success of the song. In the case of REO Speedwagon and Styx, they've scored a hit with their new tune. It's been riding near the top of the classic rock charts -- the biggest original hit by either band in years. \"The jam ... is just plain, old-school, rock 'n' roll fun,\" REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin said on the band's Web site. Should other bands follow suit and score hits, it might prompt other classic pop artists to join forces not only on tour, but in the studio as well.", "reference": "REO Speedwagon and Styx have combined for hit and tour .\nChicago and Earth, Wind & Fire recorded three songs for joint tour .\nCombining forces not new, but way it's being used may be ."}

The police worker allegedly buried his 59-year-old victim in the garden of his home near Dresden (pictured) Police search around the property in eastern Germany and are investigating if any body parts were eaten . Police started looking into the case when the victim was reported missing on November 11 by a colleague. Two days later, witnesses told officers that 'the missing man had fantasised since his youth about being killed and eaten by another person,' Kroll said. The killing happened about a month after the pair first met in an Internet chatroom, police said. 'The victim had been fantasising . about being killed and eaten by someone else since his youth,' Dresden . police chief Dieter Kroll told a news conference. Authorities are now checking whether any body parts are missing or were eaten but the suspect has denied doing so. The website they used says it deals with . 'exotic meat.'

Police President Dieter Kroll (left) and public prosecutor Erich Wenzlick (right) told reporters today they are treating the case as murder and believe a portion of the victim was eaten .

Anne, 32, said: 'When choosing a honeymoon destination, we realised the list was too long and life was too short. 'We had money saved, no kids, good health, and there is a lot of world to see - what better time to travel than now. 'We believe honeymoons are about starting a life together with a bang - having memorable and meaningful experiences rather than just splashing out on luxury. Mike, 37, said: 'Instead of spending all of our funds in a couple of weeks, we stretched our budget to last a couple of years.

'Holidays and honeymoons are often too rushed as trying to pack everything in at once. Here's five ways to make the most of your trip: . 1. Planning - make sure you use websites, guide books and friends to find out what's best and what can be missed in the city . 2. Get out early - carpe diem! You'll get the most out of your trip by getting out of bed. 3. Look for homestays and flat shares - if you want a taste of local culture, homestays are a great way to experience the local culture first hand . 4. Get flight ready - keep flight day stress to minimum by checking in online, and try to take minimal luggage. 5. Look at seasonal timings - some countries may be cheaper to travel to at different times of the year, check out which destinations have more favourable flight prices in the less fashionable seasons.'

'For example Norway cost around $75 a day each, but south east Asia worked out to be less than $20 per person. 'We kept our lodging costs low and had more local experiences by opting for homestays, housesitting, volunteering, couchsurfing.

{"id": 15165, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Q. What does NASA's \"Green Ninja,\" calm wives and military weapons in Afghanistan have in common? A. They all made Republican Sen. Tom Coburn's annual book of government waste. The Oklahoma Republican, a devout believer in small government, said the federal government wasted $28 billion in 2013 on \"questionable and lower-priority\" programs. Coburn, who supports deep cuts to the federal budget, said government waste could still be found despite outrage over the automatic budget cuts that went into effect last year. \"While (President Barack Obama) and his Cabinet issued dire warnings about the cataclysmic impacts of sequestration, taxpayers were not alerted to all of the waste being spared from the budget axe,\" Coburn wrote in his report titled \"Wastebook 2013.\" Agencies that received the money don't consider it wasted, however. The 177-page report that Coburn has been compiling for five years highlighted programs from the departments of Defense to Agriculture, from NASA to the National Institutes of Health. \"The nearly $30 billion in questionable and lower-priority spending in . \"Wastebook 2013\" is a small fraction of the more than $200 billion we throw away every year through fraud, waste, duplication and mismanagement,\" he said. Coburn's examples of waste: . Weapons destruction -- $7 billion . Weapons destruction: Coburn said the Pentagon junking weapons and vehicles used in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. \"The military has decided to simply destroy more than $7 billion worth of equipment rather than sell it or ship it back home,\" Coburn said. For instance, Coburn said \"thousands\" of heavily armored vehicles -- MRAPs --used to protect troops from roadside bombs \"will simply be shredded.\" Budget compromise clears Senate procedural hurdle . Military response: The military defended the decision, saying it will keep about 11,000 but that a large number of them are no longer necessary with new military priorities. The remaining vehicles will be offered to law enforcement and other agencies. The cost is too great to ship the rest back and refurbish them to sit unused -- about $400,000 per vehicle, the Pentagon said. Fort Hood shooter paycheck -- $52,952 . Coburn said Maj. Nadal Hasan, convicted of killing 13 people in a mass shooting at Fort Hood Army base in Texas in 2009 collected more than $278,000 in military benefits since the massacre. A military jury rendered a guilty verdict last summer, but he continued to be compensated until then. Army's response: The Army defended the payments, noting that they stopped once Hasan was convicted per military law. \"He is innocent until proven guilty,\" Army spokesman Troy Rolan, said. \"It's the same concept it is in the military as it is for civilians.\" Study: Wives should calm down -- $325,525 . Coburn points to a National Institutes of Health study that cost more than $300,000 to find that the \"happiest\" marriages \"were the ones in which the wives were able to calm down quickly\" during conflict, the researcher in the report found. \"Men who want a happy marriage are probably wise to avoid telling their wives the government's advice to resolving marital conflicts is for her to calm down,\" Coburn's report said. NIH's defense: \"Understanding how couples maintain emotional satisfaction, especially in the face of everyday conflicts and challenges, can shed light on the qualities that define successful social relationships and point to interventions to support marital health in the long term.\" The study did in fact find that \"women's ability to manage emotional conflict may be an important signal to both partners of the health of a marriage.\" The NIH said the research grant was part of a multifaceted study by the National Institute on Aging that looked at \"emotional function in aging.\" Budget deal: Who wins, who loses? NASA's little green man -- $390,000 . Coburn knocks NASA on two fronts: for its \"Green Ninja\" character to teach children about global warming and for scaling back its manned space flight program. NASA \"seems to have shifted its focus from making contact with little green men to teaching children about fictional green ninjas,\" Coburn wrote. He said the Green Ninja is supposed to be the equivalent of \"Smokey the Bear\" and is a multimedia tool for teachers to educate children about global warming. \"While this project may be fun and even educational, NASA would have a much bigger impact inspiring young people to seek out careers in science and technology by focusing its resources on its primary missions,\" Coburn wrote.

{"id": 15166, "article": "By . Associated Press and Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:53 EST, 14 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:17 EST, 14 November 2012 . On trial: Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, seen in 2011, is on trial for the murder of 16 Afghans slain in the early hours of March 11 . Army prosecutors say the U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a murderous rampage must face the death penalty for his 'heinous and despicable crimes'. Attorneys asked the investigative officer overseeing a preliminary hearing to recommend a death penalty court-martial for Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, as they made their closing arguments at the end of a week of testimony. Bales, 39, is accused of slipping away from his remote base at Camp Belambay in southern Afghanistan to attack two villages early on March 11 - nine children were among the dead. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan, and it was three weeks before American investigators could reach the crime scenes. 'Terrible, terrible things happened,' said prosecutor Major Rob Stelle. 'That is clear.' Maj. Stelle cited statements Bales made after he was apprehended, saying that they demonstrated 'a clear memory of what he had done, and consciousness of wrong-doing'. Several soldiers testified that Bales returned to the base alone just before dawn, covered in blood, and that he made incriminating statements such as, 'I thought I was doing the right thing'. An attorney for Bales argued that there was not enough information to move forward with the court-martial. 'There are a number of questions that have not been answered so far in this investigation,' attorney Emma Scanlan told the investigating officer overseeing the preliminary hearing. Scanlan said that it is still unknown what Bales' state of mind was the evening of the killings. An Army criminal investigations command special agent had testified last week that Bales tested positive for steroids three days after the killings, and other soldiers testified that Bales had been drinking the evening of the massacre. 'We've heard that Sgt. Bales was lucid, coherent and responsive,' Scanlan said in her closing argument. 'We don't know what it means to be on alcohol, steroids and sleeping aids,' she added. Accused: This courtroom sketch shows Staff Sgt Bales on the final day of his preliminary hearing at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington, U.S. The investigating officer said at . Tuesday's hearing that he would have a written recommendation by the end . of the week, but that is just the start of the process. 'Terrible, terrible things happened. That is clear' Prosecutor Major Rob Stelle . That recommendation goes next to the . brigade command, and the ultimate decision would be made by the . three-star general on the base. There's no clear sense of how long that could take before a decision is reached on whether to proceed to a court-martial trial. If a court-martial takes place, it . will be held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the Washington state base . south of Seattle, and witnesses will be flown in from Afghanistan. The military hasn't executed a service . member since 1961, and none of the six men on death row at Fort . Leavenworth, Kansas, today were convicted for atrocities against foreign . civilians. All of their crimes involved the killing of U.S. civilians or . fellow service members. In the most recent high-profile case . at Joint Base Lewis-McChord before Bales, the Army did not seek a death . penalty court-martial against five soldiers accused of killing three . Afghan civilians for sport. In that case, the ringleader was sentenced . to life in prison with possibility of parole. Bales faces 16 counts of premeditated . murder and six counts of attempted murder. The preliminary hearing, . which began on November 5, included nighttime sessions on Friday, Saturday and . Sunday for the convenience of the Afghan witnesses. Bales did not . testify. 'We are proud to stand by him': The soldier's wife Kari Bales, left, is seen with her sister Stephanie Tandberg, right, outside the military courtroom yesterday . Emma Scanlan, defence attorney for Bales, has said there is insufficient information to move foward with a death penalty court-martial . The witnesses included a seven-year-old . girl, who described how she hid behind her father when a gunman came to . their village that night, how the stranger fired, and how her father . died, cursing in pain and anger. None of the Afghan witnesses were able . to identify Bales as the shooter, but other evidence, including tests . of the blood on his clothes, implicated him, according to testimony from . a DNA expert. After the hearing concluded, Scanlan . spoke with reporters, saying that in addition to questions about Bales' state of mind, there are still questions of whether there were more . people involved. 'We all grieve deeply for the Afghani families who lost their loved ones...but we must all not rush to judgement' Statement from Staff Sgt. Bales' family . Scanlan also raised the issue of . post-traumatic stress disorder and brain injury, noting that Bales had . received a screening at the traumatic brain injury clinic at Madigan . Army Medical Center during a period of time that the center is under . investigation for reversing hundreds of PTSD diagnoses of soldiers since . 2007. 'We're in the process of investigating that,' she said. The attorney refused to confirm if Bales had ever been diagnosed with PTSD. Bales' wife, Kari, and her sister, . Stephanie Tandberg, met with reporters briefly after the hearings . concluded. Ms Tandberg read a statement, saying 'we all grieve deeply for . the Afghani families who lost their loved ones on March 11, but we must . all not rush to judgment'. Last week, the lead prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse, said on the night of the killings Bales watched a movie . about a former CIA agent on a revenge killing spree, with two fellow . soldiers, while drinking contraband whiskey. Morse said Bales first . attacked one village, Alkozai, returned to the base at Camp Belambay, . then headed out again to attack a second village, Najiban. Bales . returned to the base covered in blood, Morse said, and his incriminating . statements indicate he was 'deliberate and methodical'. In the family statement, Ms Tandberg . said: 'We all want very much to know how, why, and what happened ... Much of the testimony was painful, even heartbreaking, but we are not . convinced the government has shown us the truth, the whole truth, and . nothing but the truth about what happened that night ... We know Bob as . bright, courageous and honorable, as a man who is a good citizen, . soldier, son, husband, father, uncle and sibling. 'We in Bob's family are . proud to stand by him.' Survivor: Sadiquallah, a young boy of about 13 or 14, is sketched left at an earlier hearing during his testimony against Bales, right, after surviving the attack despite a bullet grazing his skull . Home invasion: Sadiquallah's father, Haji Naim, was the first to be shot in his home, testifying how he saw the shooter climb over a wall with a light on his head before firing . The . stories recounted by the villagers during testimony have been harrowing. They described . torched bodies, a son finding his wounded father, and boys cowering . behind a curtain while others screamed 'We are children! We are . children!' One girl, Robina, who was shot in the leg, told how she hid behind her father when the gunman came to her village, and how her father died as shots were fired. Bales sat . quietly throughout, betraying no reaction to what he heard. Robina's . friend, Zardana, now eight, also testified, but only briefly to describe . what the shooter was wearing. Zardana . suffered a gunshot wound to the top of her head, and when she arrived . at a nearby military base, the doctors focused on treating the other . injured victims first. They figured Zardana had no chance of surviving. After two months at a military . hospital in Afghanistan and three more at a Navy hospital in San Diego, . she can walk and talk again. The . Afghan witnesses recounted the villagers who lived in the attacked . compounds and listed the names of those killed, to provide a record of . the lives lost. The bodies were buried quickly under Islamic custom, and no forensic evidence was available to prove the number of victims. The military courtroom on Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington, U.S., where the preliminary hearing was held . Sadiquallah, . a slight boy of about 13 or 14 whose head rose just above his chair at . the witness table, described being awakened by a neighbor screaming that . an American had 'killed our men'. He said he and another boy, Zardana's . brother, ran to hide in a storage room and ducked behind a curtain. It . provided no protection from the bullet that grazed his head and . fractured his skull. Sadiquallah said the shooter had a gun and a light, . but he could not identify the man. The other child was hit in the thigh . and also survived. That boy, Rafiullah, testified on Saturday that an . American had attacked them and put a gun in his sister's mouth. His . father, Samiullah, was away when the shootings occurred, and testified . that by the time he returned the next morning, his two wounded children . had been driven to a base for treatment. He found his mother among the . four corpses at the compound. 'I just saw her, I cried, and I could not look on her face,' he said. Prosecutors . said that in between his attacks, Bales woke a fellow soldier, reported . what he'd done and said he was headed out to kill more. The soldier . testified that he didn't believe what Bales said, and went back to . sleep. During . cross-examination of several witnesses at the hearing, Bales' attorney, John . Henry Browne, sought to elicit testimony about whether there might have . been more than one shooter. One . Army Criminal Investigations Command special agent testified that . several months after the massacre, she took a statement from one woman . whose husband was killed. The . woman reported that there were two soldiers in her room - one took her . husband out of the room and shot him, and the other held her back when . she tried to follow. But . other eyewitnesses reported that there was just one shooter, and several . soldiers have testified that Bales returned to his base at Camp . Belambay, just before dawn, alone and covered in blood. A video taken from a surveillance blimp also captured a sole figure returning to the base.

Despite telling her boss she had no mystical qualities, Erin Auerbach took a job as a tarot reader for customers who paid to listen to her predictions on a premium phone line. What had seemed like a fun and easy way to make money soon became an emotional burden however, as Auerbach fielded calls from perverts, angry skeptics and lonely clients reaching out for human comfort and some hope. Mystic: Erin Auerbach took a job as a telephone psychic while studying in Las Vegas . Auerbach had been desperate for work while she studied theater at UNLV when she spotted a classified advert for 'phone actors'. Intrigued by the promise of working from home and setting her own hours, the 38-year-old decided to get in touch. 'Could it be true? Or was this some sort . of telemarketing scheme?' Auerbach wrote in Salon. 'I called the number. A friendly man assured me . that this was completely legit.' Lured by the promise of $7 an hour, rising to $15 for 'psychics' who racked up the most calls, Auerbach decided to give it a go, but there was just one problem. 'The thing is, I’m not sure that I’m psychic,' she admitted at a training session, but was reassured that all she would need was a professional name and a pack of tarot cards. The main purpose was to keep clients, who paid $5 a minute, on the phone for as long as possible. After reinventing herself as Anita - the name of the hospice nurse who had cared for Auerbach's father after his liver transplant - the aspiring actress was ready for her first call. Psychic phone line: Erin was employed to do tarot readings for callers . Change of fortune: Erin had moved to Las Vegas to pursue her dreams of a career in theater . 'About half of the callers were on to . me immediately. They would tell me that they thought this was nonsense . and that I was a fraud. The first surly customer I encountered pummeled . me,' Auerbach wrote in Salon. As the male caller's voice became more angry, Auerbach did her best to keep to the script and keep him on the line. 'I’m . shuffling my tarot cards. Now ask me a question, . and we’ll see if they can give you some of the answers you’re looking . for?,' she told him. 'OK, genius. What’s my wife’s name?' he replied before hanging up. The abrupt end to the call panicked Auerbach who had been warned if not enough calls lasted for an average of 10 minutes, she would be fired. Auerbach soon found a way to relate to clients, reassuring them that love - or that big career break - was just around the corner. While playing the part of Anita was difficult for Auerbach, one of her actor friends who worked for a different company, was relishing in his role. 'He thoroughly enjoyed perpetrating a fraud,' she said. 'He started each call by saying that he just drank a vial of lamb's blood to give him fortune-telling superpowers.' And although he admitted many people didn't believe him, it made for a light-hearted conversation that kept clients on the phone. Rather than making clients laugh, Auerbach's psychic hotline became a place where the lonely would talk about their problems sometimes for an entire hour. One example was a woman named Judy who called in the middle of the night. By the end of the call Auerbach knew all about her dead husband and ungrateful children. Comfort: Erin, pictured with her two dogs, found herself providing a sympathetic ear to lonely clients . 'I predicted . that she would travel and meet a new soul mate. Judy laughed a lot, . cried a little and paid $300 for the privilege of speaking to me,' Auerbach admitted. 'Those folks really didn’t give a damn about . psychics or readings. They just wanted to talk to a friendly voice,' she added. 'Some . people had terrible problems and cried a lot.' Auerbach did her best to keep calls from those in serious despair short, giving clients toll free helplines to contact instead. As well as the lonely, and the angry skeptics who would call up just to shout at her, Auerbach encountered several men under the impression that all premium rate phone lines served the same purpose. While these dodgy callers panted down the phone, asking if she knew what they were doing, Auerbach would continue with the tarot reading until meeting her ten-minute target. After that, she would end the reading and say 'Oh yeah, I know what you're doing.' And, when they asked what she thought about it, she would reply: 'Fine by me. You’re the one who’s getting screwed.' Her future as a telephone tarot reader was cut short thanks to a mysterious stranger from Alaska who had called for advice and unwittingly gave Auerbach the help she needed to see a new future for herself. The 18-year-old had wanted to know whether he should enlist in the military to help pay for college. As he talked about his parents' death and longing to find a place where he would fit in, Auerbach found herself relating to his plight. Chance encounter: A phone call from a young man desperate to fit in made Erin realize she couldn't continue as a telephone psychic . 'My . stomach hurt. I identified with his uncertainty, his searching for a . place to fit in, and his desire to escape, but I had a safety net. He . didn’t,' Auerbach said. 'That’s when it occurred to me that I had no business trying to . guide anybody’s major life decisions. I had enough trouble with my own.' When he asked what the cards were saying to do, Auerbach told him she couldn't help and suggested he went to family and friends for advice. The encounter made her end the young man's call and vow to never work as a phone psychic again.", "reference": "Premium phone line attracted the lonely, the perverted and angry skeptics .\nErin Auerbach's role as mystic 'Anita' was to keep callers on line for as long as possible ."}
{"id": 15168, "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:05 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:14 EST, 3 October 2012 . A girl battling cancer has been fitted with metal bones which will grow as she does. Lily Willis, 8, from Great Lumley, County Durham, was diagnosed with a bone cancer tumour called osteosarcoma in February after she came home from school limping just weeks earlier. The tumour, on her right leg, meant that her entire knee, tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones. As Lily grows, a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required. Lily Willis holds an x-ray of her leg, which shows her new metal bones that will grow with her over the next six years . Her mother Tori, 30, said: 'Lily came home after school one day with a sore ankle. She had been doing cross-country and was limping. We thought nothing of it and imagined she had just sprained it while she had been out running. 'But after a couple of weeks, the pain had travelled up her leg and didn’t seem to be going anywhere so I took her to the doctors. 'I thought they were just going to strap her up and send her home again - we never thought it would ever be anything serious.' But Tori and Lily’s father Bryan were in for the shock of their lives after doctors sent Lily for an X-ray, which revealed she had a tumour on the bone above her right knee. Bryan, 40, said: 'They did an X-ray of her ankle and then called us back so they could do another on her hips. 'We were told to wait five days and assumed this meant there was nothing serious going on or they would have done something straight away. 'But the hospital called us a few days later and told us we had to take Lily out of school and get her there. 'That’s when we started to worry. I could sense the urgency over the phone and I couldn’t possibly have expected what they were going to tell us.' Lily will undergo another six months of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed . Surgeons at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary performed a biopsy on Lily’s tumour and found it to be cancerous. Tori, a former florist said: 'It sounds stupid to say now but until we were told Lily had cancer, I didn’t think children got cancer. 'I’d heard of children with leukaemia but for some reason I didn’t think of them as the same thing.' Once Tori and Bryan had been told of Lily’s cancer, doctors sat the youngster down and explained to her what was wrong with her. Lily said: 'They told me I had cancer but I didn’t know what it meant. I’d heard people talking about it but I didn’t know what it was.' Tori said: 'When we were told Lily had the disease, I think my heart stopped for a second. My little girl had cancer. No parent should have to hear that. 'I thought she was going to die. We asked doctors if she was going to be OK but it was a question they couldn’t answer - they just looked at us sympathetically.' Just a week after her diagnosis in February, medics began Lily on a course of chemotherapy and performed a 14-hour operation on the youngster to remove her knee and tibia bones. They then replaced them using adjustable stainless steel to act like real bones. Xray of Lily's leg: As Lily grows, a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh . Bryan, a former mechanic, said: 'Lily was so poorly. The chemotherapy hit her hard, she was sick a lot and had very little energy. 'Her hair began to fall out which I think was hard for her - but now we can’t imagine her ever having any! 'She also contracted pneumonia - a strain which doctors said was the worst they had seen, after her lung collapsed. 'The operation was the hardest part. We didn’t think it would take that long so it was a waiting game for her to come out of theatre. The longer she was down there, the more we thought was going wrong.' But the operation was a success and after installing Lily’s new limbs, surgeons managed to reconstruct all of the muscles, tendons and even blood vessels around the new bones. As the new metal bones were too big for her leg when they were fitted, skin and tissue from her left thigh was used to stretch around her newly built limb. Now that the cancerous tissue has been removed, Lily is well on the road to recovery.

He was labelled the terrorist advocate for taking on clients accused of mass murder and torture . French lawyer Jacques Verges, nicknamed \"Terror's Advocate\" for a high-profile client list that included a former Gestapo chief and Marxist militant Carlos the Jackal, has died of a heart attack aged 88, his publisher said. Widely regarded as one of France's most brilliant, if provocative, lawyers, Verges made a name for himself by accepting clients spurned by others as impossible to defend. The lawyer died on Thursday in the Parisian house where 18th century philosopher Voltaire once lived, according to his publisher Pierre-Guillaume de Roux. 'Like Voltaire, he cultivated the art of permanent revolt and volte-face,' his publisher said in a statement. Verges was born in Thailand in 1925 to a French father and Vietnamese mother and grew up on the French-ruled Indian Ocean island of La Reunion. The family moved there after his father lost his job as consul because he married a foreigner, something forbidden at the time. In the 1960s, Verges defended Algerians fighting for independence at a time when an end to French rule in the North African possession was violently opposed by some sections of French society. As a Communist student leader, Verges befriended Pol Pot, head of the Khmer Rouge which was responsible for the genocide in Cambodia in which 2.2 million people died. Verges baffled his countrymen by agreeing to defend Klaus Barbie, head of the Gestapo in the city of Lyon who was twice sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes.

The Thailand-born lawyer befriended Pol Pot, pictured, the Communist ruler of the Khmer Rouge and the Prime Minister of Cambodia (offically Democratic Kampuchea during his rule) from 1975-1979 . When Barbie fled France in 1944, Verges was marching to liberate Paris with de Gaulle's Free French forces. 'If he (Barbie) had been at the end of the barrel of my gun, I would have shot him,' Verges told Reuters in an interview in 2002. 'Now I am simply doing my job as a lawyer.' Jacques Vergs (left) maintained his friendship with the Pol Pot family, and was filmed dining with Noun Chea (right), the brother number two of the Khmer Rouge, for a 2007 French documentary . Other high profile clients included Lebanese militant Georges Ibrahim Abdallah and former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, and he also gave legal advice to ex-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. For some of his critics, Verges' client list meant his hands were as soiled as those of the people he defended. In 2007, a French documentary about his life dubbed him the 'Terror's Advocate', a nickname that stuck.", "reference": "Verges befriended Pol Pot, head of the Khmer Rouge and defended Tariq Aziz, the former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister .\nHis critics said his client list meant his hands were as soiled as those of the people he defended ."}

Jude Medcalf, 23, spent 75 days on remand earlier this year for stealing food and Christmas presents from an NHS office and firing a BB gun at a woman. But a judge at Exeter Crown Court ordered his release in March because he suffers from Klinefelter Syndrome, a growth disorder meaning he’s too big for standard prison beds and uniforms. Scroll down for video . Jude Medcalf, 23, who was released from jail earlier this year because he was too tall for the beds, has been back in court accused of breaching his curfew . Medcalf was instead given a 12-month community order and six-month curfew after he pleaded guilty to possession of an imitation firearm and a bladed article, criminal damage and burglary. But Medcalf - who is nicknamed Tiny - was back in court today after breaching his curfew. Medcalf, whose condition and means he is still growing and is only capable of adolescent emotions, was supposed to be at home between midnight to 6am every night. However the court heard Medcalf worked at a fairground and his bosses sometimes asked him to stay late without warning. His lawyer said he only breached his curfew because he was so desperate to keep his job. Judge Graham Cottle decided to lift the curfew six weeks early so Medcalf of Newton Abbot, Devon, could carry on working. The judge said: 'A curfew is designed to address a case where people are out committing crimes in the evening and it seems like Mr Medcalf isn’t.

Medcalf was arrested after he terrified an innocent woman by firing a BB gun at her, and then went on to steal £30 of Christmas presents and £20 tea money from an NHS office. He was later found with stolen food - including a large amount of rump steak, which was taken from The Sloop pub in Newton Abbot while it was open and staff were distracted.

{"id": 15171, "article": "A councillor who left an expletive-laden message on a junior colleague's answerphone has been accused of being the 'Malcolm Tucker of local politics'. Liverpool City Council’s Labour chief whip Councillor Alan Dean has been compared to the foul-mouthed spin doctor in the hit political comedy The Thick Of It after the voicemail was leaked online. The character, played by new Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, is best known for his screaming tirades at Cabinet ministers and his underlings. And Cllr Dean pulls a remarkable impersonation of Tucker in an answerphone message for former Labour councillor Jake Morrison. 'You have really p***** on your chips this time mate': Cllr Alan Dean, pictured left, has been compared to  Malcolm Tucker, the spin doctor in The Thick Of It, pictured right, after leaving a foul-mouthed rant on a young councillor's phone . Cllr Dean can be heard on the voicemail asking Cllr Morrison 'what the hell he was playing at' after apparently telling a local paper he may step down after just one term in office. He then continues his tirade, repeatedly swearing, before shouting: 'You have really p***** on your chips this time mate'. Cllr Morrison, who became the city’s youngest elected councillor when he won an election aged 18 in 2011, was suspended shortly afterwards by the Labour party following complaints about his behaviour by fellow council member Wavertree MP Luciana Berger. He claimed he was the victim of a 'witch-hunt' and wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband slamming Miss Berger as a 'privately-educated MP from London who has come to Liverpool to make my life a misery'. He also complained to the city mayor . that he wasn't happy that Cllr Dean was looking into Miss Berger's . complaints because of the voicemail. Cllr Morrison resigned from his post last month and has now uploaded the clip to Youtube and Facebook with the message: 'Just been clearing up my little desktop and found this voicemail I recorded. 'One for those know-it-alls who like to paint their own little picture about why I left the Labour Party.' Embarrassing: Cllr Jake Morrison resigned from Liverpool City Council, pictured, and released the footage online to show what life in local politics is like . Cllr Morrison said he chose to release the tape now, more than three months after the phonecall, because: 'As time goes on, I’m getting criticised – people don’t know half the picture that went on and this is something I decided to do to quite clearly outline the way I was treated and something needs to be done about it. 'I just wanted to show people the way I was treated... it’s aggressive, it’s nasty, it was bullying as far as I’m concerned. 'The chief whip’s role is not just about punishing people, it’s about supporting people. Cllr Dean has been around in politics for 20 years, that’s how he speaks to someone who has been in it for two. 'He seems to think he’s the Malcolm Tucker of local politics.' Cllr Alan Dean admitted he left the voicemail. He added: 'It’s quite obvious that I left the voicemail message, I don’t deny that, I don’t retract anything I say in it. 'I was very angry at the time for what he had done and the way he behaved after all the support he got.' Cllr Dean also denied that the tape reflected his typical style as party whip and claimed Cllr Morrison had 'stabbed us in the back'. He added: 'I think people can draw their own conclusions from the fact of the date it was sent and the date it was published and that’s taken so long if he was so offended about it why has he published it so long [after]. I believe he’s got an ulterior motive in doing so.'", "reference": "Liverpool City Council's Labour chief whip Alan Dean left a foul-mouthed rant on cllr Jake Morrison's answerphone after hearing he wished to resign .\nCllr Morrison released the voicemail to show what local politics is like .\nHe compared Cllr Dean to the spin doctor in the TV series The Thick Of It ."}

The remarks came several days into a shaky ceasefire deal between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia rebels, signed last Friday after nearly five months of fighting in eastern Ukraine. The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine are \"broadly satisfied\" with the status of the ceasefire, a Kremlin aide said Wednesday. President Vladimir Putin and Poroshenko spoke by phone Tuesday night, Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russia's Interfax news agency. \"On the whole, satisfaction was expressed on our part and by the Ukrainian side with how the ceasefire is being observed although it is a difficult process,\" Ushakov said. Moscow has repeatedly denied allegations by Kiev and the West that it is sending Russian troops over the border into Ukraine. Meanwhile, EU leaders are weighing whether to pull the trigger on tougher sanctions against Russia. Talks are planned Thursday in Brussels among diplomats from the 28 member nations, following a decision Monday to put on hold for at least a \"few days\" a new package of economic penalties against Russia over its encroachment in Ukraine. The delay offered more time to assess the effectiveness of the ceasefire without risking further trade retaliation by the Kremlin, which has said it will respond if new sanctions come into force. OSCE to deploy drones . The chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the truce, said Wednesday that more observers would be sent to eastern Ukraine. \"Around 70 specialists are in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions this week already to monitor the ceasefire. Further monitors are being recruited and deployed as we speak,\" Didier Burkhalter said. The OSCE will be using its own drones over the region soon, he said. A discussion is also under way on the possible deployment of drones from some of the 57 member states of the OSCE. Burkhalter, who is also the Swiss President and Foreign Minister, said his country was ready to support the OSCE mission in Ukraine with up to 10 additional monitors and an extra 500,000 euros ($647,000.)

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu blamed Ukraine for the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in comments Wednesday after meeting with Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein in Moscow, Russia's state-run Itar-Tass new agency reported. \"The catastrophe happened in the skies of Ukraine, which is fully responsible for what happened,\" Shoigu is quoted as saying. \"I'm convinced that this tragedy wouldn't have happened if Ukraine had solved its internal crisis without use of military force, including artillery, missiles, and war aviation.\" A preliminary report into the crash in July, released by Dutch aviation investigators Tuesday, said the plane was brought down by \"high energy objects\" from outside. The U.S. and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane, which had 298 people on board, using a Russian-made missile system.

{"id": 15175, "article": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO's goal of ending combat operations in Afghanistan and leaving security in local hands by the end of 2014 is realistic, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday on his second visit to the nation in 2010. \"It's challenging, but it is achievable,\" Cameron said. \"What I see is actually some grounds for cautious optimism.\" Cameron cited the continued training of the Afghan National Army and the nation's police force, noting 500 police officers are coming out of a British-run police academy every eight weeks. \"There are more markets open, more children going to school, local governors providing legitimate governance with the local population rejecting the brutal shadow (of the) Taliban regime,\" Cameron said during a joint news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the same conference, Cameron addressed the international WikiLeaks situation. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has been under intense pressure from the United States and its allies since it began posting the first of more than 250,000 U.S. State Department documents on November 28. \"I don't want the WikiLeaks to come between our strong relationship. Some of what was referred to was the fact that there was not enough troops in Helmand province in the past, and that is certainly true,\" Cameron said. \"It's clear that we did not have enough troops in Helmand to actually deliver the security that was necessary.\" But Cameron added, \"I think you can now see on the ground with 20,000 U.S. Marines, with some 10,000 U.K. forces, you really can see a density of forces that are able to deliver security to the vast majority of the people.\" Karzai, who said WikiLeaks documents have \"some truth and some not so truth in them,\" replied in a less serious tone. \"On a lighter side, you should wait for the WikiLeaks from Britain so our conversation with Britain's leaked on America,\" the Afghan president said, drawing laughter from the British prime minister. \"We're very nice about that, just to be clear,\" Cameron said. \"Most of the time,\" Karzai quipped. NATO has some 150,000 troops in Afghanistan, pressing the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda. About 9,500 of the forces are British, according to the country's Ministry of Defence. During the joint press conference, Karzai expressed his gratitude to Britain. \"Britain has been as steadfast supporter of Afghanistan and of the Afghan people,\" Karzai said. \"Britain has contributed in the sacrifice of its soldiers, of blood and of resources in Afghanistan for which the Afghan people are extremely grateful. You have been operating as a British army and trainers and civilians in a very difficult part of the country. We fully understand and appreciate the hard work that you are doing.\" Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander in Afghanistan, has stepped up attacks on militants since taking over the command in June and is seeing progress as a result. In an October interview with CNN, he said he expects to be able to recommend to U.S. President Barack Obama that the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan could start being reduced beginning in July 2011. But Petraeus declined to say how many troops might be headed home. Cameron said he shares a similar optimism, adding he believes some British troops could start heading home before Christmas 2011. \"I think that it's possible,\" he said. \"We have to deliver on the ground what's necessary.\" Cameron said British forces are ahead of schedule in training the Afghan army. \"We have a very clear timetable for transition in Afghanistan.

{"id": 15176, "article": "Philadelphia (CNN) -- Robert Sanabria thought he would never see his big brother again. Robert was 15 when his brother, Edwin, left home at age 18. Born prematurely with only one functioning lung, Edwin spent his school years in special education classes, Robert said. He remembered his brother as soft-spoken, humble and kindhearted. \"When he left, he just took off,\" Robert told CNN by phone last Saturday. \"He was in love and ran away.\" He last saw his brother in 1999. Neighbors and friends would tell Robert they thought they spotted Edwin around the city. \"It was like a bigfoot sighting,\" he said. \"Every time they said they saw him it went nowhere. The information led to a dead end.\" Robert, 29, is a sergeant in the U.S. Army who lives with his wife outside Fort Bragg, North Carolina. All his years of military training and combat experience couldn't prepare him for what happened a few weeks ago. In mid-October, Robert received a call from his father, who told him police might have found Edwin locked in a dank Philadelphia basement with three other people. The pitch-black, 15-by-6-foot space discovered by the owner of the apartment building houses what police described as an abandoned boiler room, where the overwhelming stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber two days after the discovery. Hours after his father's phone call, Robert made the nine-hour drive north to see if his long-lost brother was among the four victims. \"It made me nauseous. I was anxious. It was eating me up. I was crying on the way up there. If that gut feeling wasn't there, I wouldn't have gone,\" he said. \"We still didn't know if it was him, but there was only one way to find out.\" Media reports identified Edwin Sanabria and Tamara Breeden as two of the victims. \"When I saw their names together, I knew it was my brother and his girlfriend. I couldn't believe it,\" Robert said. When Edwin left his Philadelphia home at 18, he told Robert he was staying with his girlfriend, Tamara, and her family, Robert said. \"They were in love. We were hoping that they were being taken care of,\" Robert said. After Edwin lost contact with his family, the Sanabrias asked for help in tracking him down from Philadelphia police and the local Social Security Administration office, which distributed disability benefits checks to Edwin. Their efforts were in vain. Edwin was an adult who left home on his own, so the police couldn't intervene. Access to Edwin's personal information from the Social Security Administration wasn't possible because it was considered a violation of his privacy, Robert said. It would take more than a decade for the Sanabrias to discover Edwin's fate. Robert said it was Breeden who introduced Edwin to one of his alleged captors, and he believes his brother's abuse could have started soon after Edwin left home. Police have not said how long Edwin may have been captive. Last month in Philadelphia, Robert and his father met with police and were sent to a health care facility where the captives were being evaluated. Expecting a hug and ceremonious reunion, Robert was greeted with a nonchalant head nod. Exhausted and feeling defeated, he began to cry, fearing his brother no longer even recognized him, he said. But as if on cue, Edwin stood up and walked over to the stunned men and said, \"Pop,\" to his father. Robert, a self-described tough guy who completed two tours in Iraq, wept uncontrollably. \"I am bawling. I realized how much I missed him, how much I loved him,\" he said. \"He looked really, really skinny and really malnourished.\" Then Edwin started looking closer at his crying brother and said, \"Robert?\" He quickly flashed Edwin his military ID. Edwin held it inches from his face, almost straining to read it, Robert said. Edwin started talking, and then wrapped his lanky arms around his baby brother. \"He gave me a long hug,\" Robert said. \"Then he said, 'You know what I want? I want a cheesesteak.' So I went and got him one as fast as I could.\" Police arrested Linda Ann Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, Eddie Wright, 49, and Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, 32, for allegedly imprisoning four mentally disabled adults in the basement boiler room. They face a host of charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment. Weston, Wright and McIntosh face additional charges -- including aggravated assault, simple assault, kidnapping and reckless endangerment -- in connection with the alleged abuse of Weston's niece, Beatrice Weston, authorities said. A hearing for the new charges is set for November 15. All four suspects in the case are scheduled to appear in court on December 19. Weston had identification documents for about 50 people with her when she was arrested, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Those documents included Social Security cards and court documents giving power of attorney. Police said they were investigating whether the victims' Social Security checks had been stolen, as well as several other leads. In addition to the four captives found in the basement, authorities have located 10 other potential victims, including six children, Ramsey said. Police believe two of the six children placed in protective custody -- ages 2 and 5 -- are the children of Tamara Breeden. DNA testing is being conducted to confirm paternity, but the Sanabrias believe Edwin is the father. Edwin is slowly opening up about his ordeal, Robert said. Edwin never fled because he loved Breeden and he was never left alone, he said. He also said he was mistreated by Weston's teenage sons. Edwin said he would often fight back and share his food with the others while he was with Weston, Robert said. Edwin said he would also intercept blows intended for Breeden. Edwin also recalled separate incidents in which he was sliced with a knife and shot with a BB gun, Robert said. Edwin told his brother that one of the captives, Herbert Knowles, had seizures in the basement, so he gave him water and placed a cold rag on his head, Robert said. He said the water came from the same bucket they used as a toilet and to bathe. Worried about the physical and emotional abuse his brother endured, Robert said he plans to have Edwin come live with him, and vows to protect him to the end. \"The first thing I wanted to tell him was that this was not his fault, that everybody gets tricked,\" he said. \"It's disturbing. It still messes with me. They (the defendants) all deserve life in prison.\"", "reference": "U.S. Army Sgt.

They're both from New York.) We're not a boorish population living in an industrial wasteland. The same old disparaging remarks have made Garden Staters thick-skinned underdogs. I'm convinced the New Jersey Turnpike was built to keep outsiders out, because the concrete blight along many stretches shows no evidence of why Jersey is called the Garden State. Once you get off on any exit, you will see Jersey is so much more than what most saw in the \"Sopranos\" introduction. I'm here to clear the air: New Jersey is one of the most underestimated states in the country. Don't knock it until you've traveled it. Want to give it a try? Here are six spots to check out from north to south. Jersey City . Go on a food tour of diverse Jersey City. You'll find authentic and affordable Mexican food at Taqueria, a savory crepe at French restaurant Madame Claude's, new American food using seasonal, local ingredients at Thirty Acres, and don't miss Marco and Pepe's for brunch (three words: croissant French toast). Once you've sufficiently indulged, catch a movie at the Loew's Jersey Theatre, a not-for-profit historic landmark built in 1929 that has hosted the likes of Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington, Jean Harlow, Bob Hope and, more recently, the American rock band Neutral Milk Hotel. Cool, right? If you want to get in touch with mother nature in this densely populated area, head north for a hike or bike ride in beautiful Palisades Interstate Park, a historic national landmark, and one of my favorite places in the world. West New York, New Jersey . Hungry after the hiking and biking? Luckily you're minutes away from some of the best Hispanic food in the tri-state area in West New York. Head over to Bergenline Avenue, the longest commercial avenue in New Jersey, and go for a nice long urban stroll with ample people-watching, shopping and eats from El Salvadorean to Mexican to Peruvian or Cuban. So many choices. Having trouble deciding? Start stretching your stomach at Dulce de Leche, an Argentine cafe and bakery where magical dulce de leche pastries and beef, chicken, ham, cheese or spinach empanadas are made with mucho amor. Princeton . If you're looking for a mix of history, an art scene and tree-lined streets, then you're hankering for Princeton. Fancy. Take a walking tour of Princeton University's Ivy League campus, which dates to 1754. It's well worth it. As for art, you'll want to head over to the Princeton University Art Museum, which houses more than 72,000 works of art. After soaking in all that art and culture, stop for a treat. Now, while I've heard the Bent Spoon is where \"the party is at\" for their gelatos, I can only vouch for Thomas Sweet Ice Cream on Nassau Street. They're famous for their blend-ins, way before a chain ice cream shop became popular for it. Since you're already on Nassau Street, you might as well shop. It only makes sense. Bookstores, dining spots and gift shops, oh my! Frenchtown . Now that you're an unofficial Garden Stater, you'll want to get in your car and drive (it's what we do) to Frenchtown, along the banks of the Delaware River. Rolling hills, green fields and scenic views support the state's lush moniker. If you're there anywhere from May to September, slap on some sunscreen and go for a gentle tube ride or some rafting. For those looking for some imported furniture or home decor from Southeast Asia, go to Two Buttons, owned by the author of \"Eat, Pray, Love,\" Elizabeth Gilbert, and her husband. Asbury Park . Now, as the locals say, we're \"going down the shore.\" Out-of-towners have a stale notion of caked layers of fake tanning spray and so-called guidos galore along the Jersey Shore, thanks to the MTV show. The state's coast is actually defined by its historic boardwalks, arcades and amusement parks thick with nostalgia. When I want to stay close to the tri-state area but still want to feel like I went on a mini-getaway, I go to Asbury Park. I love it's old-timey charm, boardwalk, lounges and restaurants, and, of course, beaches. It never gets completely packed with people, so you'll find some peace and quiet. If you're a Bruce Springsteen fan (of course you are, who isn't!?), you should make it a point to go to the historic Stone Pony, where he got his start. Not far is Asbury Lanes, another no-frills but fun music venue and vintage bowling alley. Cape May . Finally, for a real getaway, keep driving south until you reach the southern tip of Jersey and charming and quaint Cape May, which stakes a claim as the nation's oldest seaside resort. A National Historic Landmark, Cape May is filled with lovely Victorian homes. You can stroll on the boardwalk, visit the historic Cape May lighthouse, go whale or dolphin watching or go wine tasting at the Cape May Winery. Embrace your inner Jersey girl and enjoy some of the Garden State's finer things before the rest of the out-of-towners catch on. But if you don't, it's no skin off our back. More for us.", "reference": "New Jersey is the butt of jokes once again, thanks to its governor .\nBut from Princeton to Asbury Park, New Jersey is for travelers .\nTry ethnic food in Jersey City; explore nature in Frenchtown ."}
{"id": 15179, "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:08 EST, 3 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:12 EST, 3 December 2013 . Amazon’s plan to let self-guided drones deliver packages has run in to regulatory turbulence. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of the online giant, is working on a way to use small aircraft to get parcels to customers in 30 minutes or less. While flight technology makes it feasible, U.S. law and society's attitude toward drones haven't caught up with Bezos' vision. The company says it's working on the so-called Prime Air unmanned aircraft project but it will take years to advance the technology and for the Federal Aviation Administration to create the necessary rules and regulations. Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos says that he wants to use octocoptors (pictured) to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes - and now has plans to begin sending orders before customers even click buy . The project was first reported by CBS' '60 Minutes' Sunday night, where Bezos said that while his octocopters look like something out of science fiction, there's no reason they can't be used as delivery vehicles. Bezos said the drones can carry packages that weigh up to five pounds, which covers about 86 per cent of the items Amazon delivers. The drones the company is testing have a range of about 10 miles, which Bezos noted could cover a significant portion of the population in urban areas. Bezos told '60 Minutes' the project could become a working service in four or five years. Unlike the drones used by the military, Bezos' proposed flying machines won't need humans to control them remotely. Amazon's drones would receive a set of GPS coordinates and automatically fly to them, presumably avoiding buildings, power lines and other obstacles. Delivery drones raise a host of concerns, from air traffic safety to homeland security and privacy. There . are technological and legal obstacles, too —similar to Google's . experimental driverless car. How do you design a machine that safely . navigates the roads or skies without hitting anything? And, if an . accident occurs, who's legally liable? Delivering packages by drone might be impossible in a city like Washington D.C. which has many no-fly zones. To the door: The drones will be programmed with the specific GPS coordinates of an address . Most items: 86 per cent of the shipments made by Amazon way less than five pounds, which is the amount of weight that the drones would be able to carry . 'It's fascinating as an idea and probably very hard to execute,' says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies who sees Bezos as an unconventional thinker. 'If he could really deliver something you order within 30 minutes, he would rewrite the rules of online retail.' Amazon spends heavily on growing its business, improving order fulfillment and expanding into new areas. Those investments have come at the expense of consistent profitability, but investors have been largely forgiving, focusing on the company's long-term promise and double-digit revenue growth. Headed to Washington: U.S. law forbid the commercial use of unmanned drones so negotiations with the FAA will be important to allow the Amazon initiative to be permitted . The company spent almost $2.9billion in shipping last year, accounting for 4.7 per cent of its net sales. There is no prohibition on flying drones for recreational use, but since 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration has said they can't be used for commercial purposes. 'The technology has moved forward faster than the law has kept pace,' says Brendan Schulman, special counsel at the law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP. Schulman is currently challenging that regulation before a federal administrative law judge on behalf of a client who was using a radio-controlled aircraft to shoot video for an advertising agency. Autonomous flights like Amazon is proposing, without somebody at the controls, are also prohibited. The . FAA is slowly moving forward with guidelines on commercial drone use. Last year, Congress directed the agency to grant drones access to U.S. skies by September 2015, but the agency already has missed several key . deadlines and said the process would take longer than Congress expected. The . FAA plans to propose rules next year that could allow limited use of . drones weighing up to 55 pounds, but those rules are also expected to . include major restrictions on where drones can fly, posing significant . limits on what Amazon could do. Many of the commercial advances in drone use have come out of Europe, Australia, and Japan. In Australia, for instance, an electric company is using drones to check on remote power lines. 'The delay has really been to the disadvantage of companies here,' Schulman says. 'Generally, the government wants to promote the advancement of science and technology. In this case, the government has done exactly the opposite and thwarted the ability of small, startup companies to develop commercial applications for this revolutionary technology.' Man with a plan: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled the controversial drones during an interview with 60 Minutes . Amazon isn't the only company awaiting guidelines. A Domino's franchise in the United Kingdom released a test flight video in June of the 'DomiCopter,' a drone used to deliver hot pizza. The FAA said Monday that it is moving forward with 'regulations and standards for the safe integration of remote piloted (drones) to meet increased demand.' The agency reiterated that 'autonomous (drone) operation is not currently allowed in the United States.' Given the slow pace at which the FAA typically approves regulations, Bezos' prediction of four or five years for approval seems unrealistic to many. Safety concerns could be the real obstacle in delaying drones for widespread commercial use. 'You're putting a device with eight rapidly spinning blades into areas where people are assumed to be,' says Matt Waite, a journalism professor at the University of Nebraska and head of the university's Drone Journalism Lab. 'The threat to people on the ground is significant.' According to Amazon's website, the goal of the new delivery system is to get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles . It's not hard to imagine that the world's biggest online retailer has some significant lobbying muscle and might be able to persuade the FAA to alter the rules. Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako says the company has been in contact with the FAA 'as they are actively working on necessary regulation.' One of the biggest promises for civilian drone use is in agriculture because of the industry's largely unpopulated, wide open spaces. Delivering Amazon packages in midtown Manhattan will be much trickier. But the savings of such a delivery system only come in large, urban areas. Besides regulatory approval, Amazon's biggest challenge will be to develop a collision avoidance system, says Darryl Jenkins, a consultant who gave up on the commercial airline industry and now focuses on drones. Who is to blame, Jenkins asked, if the drone hits a bird, crashes into a building? Who is going to insure the deliveries? There are also technical questions. Who will recharge the drone batteries? How many deliveries can the machines make before needing service? Spanning the country: The drones are being tested over a 10-mile radius at the moment but Bezos says that will work for most urban areas . 'Jeff Bezos might be the single person in the universe who could make something like this happen,' Jenkins says. 'For what it worth, this is a guy who's totally changed retailing.' If Amazon gets its way, others might follow. United Parcel Service Co. executives heard a presentation from a drone vendor earlier this year, says Alan Gershenhorn, UPS' chief sales, marketing and strategy officer. 'Commercial use of drones is an interesting technology, and we're certainly going to continue to evaluate it,' Gershenhorn says. The U.S. Postal Service and FedEx wouldn't speculate about using drones for delivery.", "reference": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has announced the online retailer has secretly been testing drones that will delivery packages directly to people's doors .\nProject is at least five years from reality due to still-to-be-determined FAA regulations .\nLegal questions about who would be responsible if the drones crashed are causing concern since they could injure people on the ground ."}
{"id": 15180, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Food safety regulators don't expect any more recalls after last week's withdrawal of about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market, but inspections are still going on following a salmonella outbreak traced to two Iowa farms, federal officials said Monday. Jeff Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the Food and Drug Administration, said it was \"a little premature\" to discuss the findings of those inspections. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Sunday night that farms involved in the recall fell short of safety standards. Farrar would not release details of the inspections, which also involve a third operation that supplied the two egg producers, but the results could be released later this week, he said. About 1,300 cases of salmonella have been linked to eggs from Wright County Eggs and Hillandale Farms of Iowa, forcing a recall of their products in at least 17 states, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control reported. Wright County Egg has recalled 380 million eggs, while Hillandale Farms recalled 170 million eggs. \"We have a very complicated network of food distribution in this country,\" Hamburg told CNN's \"American Morning\" on Monday. \"You start with a couple of farms in Iowa and you can get nationwide exposure.\" Speaking on a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon, Hamburg said federal regulations that took effect in July could have prevented the recall. The new regulation went into effect July 9, requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. The current outbreak began in May, according to the FDA. \"We believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier time, it would have very likely enabled us to identify the problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred,\" Hamburg said. While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Farrar said under the new rule, \"We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States.\" The FDA said some companies that bought and resold eggs from Wright County or Hillandale could issue sub-recalls, meaning they would ask their customers to return the products. But that won't add to the more than half a billion eggs already recalled. The Danielson family of Watertown, Minnesota, was among those afflicted by the outbreak. \"Everybody had diarrhea. That was kind of the first thing,\" Todd Danielson told CNN affiliate KARE, \"and then headaches and then throwing up and then it was body aches. I couldn't even move. I mean it was like in your joints it hurt so bad. It was worse than any flu I've ever had.\" Brittany Danielson, 10, added, \"We thought we had the flu, but then we saw the egg recall and we figured that's what it was because my dad read off the symptoms from the computer and those were all the symptoms we had.\" The Danielsons and their neighbors both told KARE they bought Hillandale Farms eggs at Wal-Mart. Hillandale Farms, one of the largest U.S. producers, said in a statement Sunday it is devastated by the possible connection between its product and salmonella. The company said it would work with the FDA to review \"every phase of our operation\" and fix any problems. Both Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms were supplied by another company, Quality Egg, which provided feed and young birds. Both Wright County and Quality Egg are owned by the DeCoster family, which has a string of agribusiness interests in the Midwest and Northeast. Those companies' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month. In June, company owner Jack DeCoster admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in Maine after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. Dr. Donald E. Hoenig, the Maine state veterinarian, said the allegations included keeping too many birds in cases, failing to treat injured chickens or promptly remove dead animals, and improper euthanization. Hoenig said DeCoster and his company agreed to a $25,000 fine and made a $100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility. In 1996, the Labor Department accused DeCoster of maintaining \"sweatshop conditions\" for migrant workers at its Turner, Maine, chicken farm, where then-Labor Secretary Robert Reich said workers risked salmonella by handling dead chickens and manure with their bare hands. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $3.6 million. In January 2002, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission hit another DeCoster company with allegations that its supervisors sexually assaulted and harassed female employees, some of whom were in the country illegally, and threatened to retaliate against them if they complained. The managers were fired for \"unrelated reasons,\" the EEOC said, and DeCoster agreed to pay a settlement of more than $1.5 million. In 2000, Iowa's attorney general declared DeCoster a \"habitual violator\" of state environmental laws after a series of discharges of manure from his hog-farming operations. He paid a $150,000 penalty and had to build six concrete storage structures, and his company was barred from expanding those operations. In a statement issued Monday morning, Wright County Egg said it was working with the FDA on the current recalls and defended its record. \"Wright County Egg strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner, and our management team has worked closely with FDA through their review of our farms. We have reviewed Commissioner Hamburg's comments to the media, but because we have not received any written reports from FDA to date, it would be inappropriate to respond to her remarks. It is important to note that any concerns raised verbally during FDA's on-farm visit were immediately addressed or are in the process of being addressed,\" the statement said. \"When issues have been raised about our farms, our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively, working with recognized outside experts to identify and implement corrective measures for our operations,\" it said. \"We are approaching our work with FDA in the same forthright manner.\" While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the Egg Safety Center, a trade association entity. \"This is one of the larger recalls that have happened,\" Eberle said. But she added, \"This is an extremely rare occurrence.\" CNN's Don Lemon, Sandra Endo and Matt Smith contributed to this report.", "reference": "NEW: Inspections continue, but no further recalls expected, FDA says .\nA Minneapolis family says eggs caused diarrhea, headaches and vomiting .\nWright County Egg says it's working to implement corrective measures .\n\"Complicated\" food distribution network can expose the entire nation, official says ."}

One boy was 7 or 8, another was 10, and the third was 12 or 13 at the time. According to the grand jury report, the now-adult men said Sandusky engaged in inappropriate conduct ranging from touching to outright sexual encounters, including several incidents during the nights before Penn State football home games, when the team, staff and boys Sandusky had allegedly invited were staying at a hotel. 1998 -- Penn State police and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare investigate an incident in which the mother of an 11-year-old boy reported that Sandusky had showered with her son and may have had inappropriate conduct with him. In a June 1, 1998, interview with investigators from both agencies, Sandusky admits showering naked with the boy, admitting that it was wrong and promising not to do it again, according to the grand jury report. The district attorney advises investigators that no charges will be filed and the university police chief instructs that the case be closed, according to the testimony included in the grand jury report from the police detective who investigated the incident. 1999 -- Sandusky retires from Penn State after coaching there for 32 years but stays on as a volunteer and retains full access to the campus and football facilities. 2000 -- Sandusky allegedly showers with a young boy and tries to touch his genitals during overnight stays at the coach's house, according to the now 24-year-old man's testimony included in the grand jury report. 2000 -- Jim Calhoun, a janitor at the Lasch Football Building on the Penn State campus, tells his supervisor and another janitor that he saw Sandusky performing oral sex on a young boy, according to the grand jury report. A second janitor reports that he saw Sandusky and a boy leave a shower room and walk out of the building hand in hand. No one reports the alleged incidents to university officials or law enforcement, according to the grand jury report. March 2, 2002 -- According to the grand jury report, a graduate assistant allegedly tells Head Coach Joe Paterno that he saw Sandusky in the locker room shower the night before, performing anal sex on a young boy he estimated to be 10 years old. March 3, 2002 -- Paterno reports the incident to Athletic Director Tim Curley, saying the graduate assistant had seen Sandusky \"fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy,\" according to the grand jury. Later, the assistant is summoned to a meeting with Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz.. While the assistant later insisted to the grand jury that he told Curley and Schultz that he saw Sandusky and the boy engaged in anal sex, Curley and Schultz told the grand jury they had not been told of such an allegation. Instead, Curley said he had the impression the conduct amounted to nonsexual \"horsing around.\" Schultz said he couldn't remember details but seemed to recall that \"Sandusky might have inappropriately grabbed the young boy's genitals while wrestling,\" according to the grand jury. Sandusky's locker-room keys are confiscated, he is told not to bring his Second Mile participants to campus, and the incident is reported to the charity, but no law enforcement investigation is launched, according to the grand jury. 2002 -- The Second Mile learns of the alleged shower incident. Curley tells the charity that \"the information had been internally reviewed and that there was no finding of wrongdoing,\" the group said in a statement Monday. 2005 or 2006 -- Sandusky allegedly befriends another Second Mile participant, whose allegations would form the foundation of the multiyear grand jury investigation. 2006 or 2007 -- A wrestling coach at the high school where Sandusky is volunteering allegedly surprises Sandusky and a boy \"lying on their sides, in physical contact, face to face on a mat\" in a cramped weight room. Sandusky jumps to his feet and tells the coach the two were just working on wrestling moves, the coach later recalls in grand jury testimony. As time goes on, Sandusky allegedly begins to spend more time with the boy, taking him to sporting events and giving him gifts, including golf clubs, a computer, cash and clothes. During this period, according to the grand jury report, Sandusky allegedly performs oral sex on the boy more than 20 times, and the boy performs oral sex on him once. 2008 -- The boy breaks off contact with Sandusky. Later, his mother calls the high school to report her son had been sexually assaulted, and the principal bars Sandusky from campus and reports the incident to police. In grand jury testimony, the principal, Steven Turchetta, recalls Sandusky's behavior as suspicious and says Sandusky was often \"clingy\" and \"needy\" when a student no longer wanted to spend time with him. The ensuing investigation reveals 118 calls from Sandusky's home and cell phone numbers to the boy's home. November 2008 -- Sandusky informs the Second Mile that he is under investigation, and he is removed from all program activities involving children, according to the group. September 2010 -- Sandusky retires from the Second Mile, according to the grand jury. November 4, 2011 -- The grand jury report is released. November 5 -- Authorities arrest Sandusky on seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and numerous other charges, including aggravated indecent assault, corruption of minors and endangering the welfare of a child. He is freed on $100,000 unsecured bail. Curley, 57, and Schultz, 62, are each charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations. November 6 -- Curley asks for and is granted administrative leave to deal with the charges, while Schultz steps down from his post to retire. November 7 -- Penn State students rally outside Paterno's home. November 9 -- Paterno issues a statement saying he will retire at the end of the 2011 football season, adding, \"I wish I had done more.\" The U.S. Department of Education says it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year. University trustees announce that night that Paterno and University President Graham Spanier have been removed, effective immediately. Angry students riot in State College, Pennsylvania. November 10 -- Sandusky's attorney, Joseph Amendola, tells CNN his client disputes the grand jury report and is \"destroyed\" over what happened to Paterno. Penn State says Mike McQueary, the graduate assistant who saw the alleged 2002 incident involving Sandusky and a young boy, will not be at Saturday's football game because of \"multiple threats.\" November 11 -- Penn State officials say they will create a special panel to investigate the allegations. The university announces McQueary has been placed on \"indefinite\" leave. Students hold a candlelight vigil to honor the alleged victims. Authorities in San Antonio say they are investigating the possibility that Sandusky might have committed sex crimes there in 1999 when Penn State played in the Alamo Bowl, CNN affiliates report. Victim 4 in the Pennsylvania grand jury report had been listed as a member of Sandusky's family party for the bowl game. November 12 -- Fans hold a moment of silence before Penn State's football team plays Nebraska. The Nittany Lions lose, 17-13. November 13 -- Pennsylvania needs to change its law in the wake of the scandal over alleged child sexual abuse by a then-member of Penn State's football coaching team, Gov. Tom Corbett says on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" November 14 -- Questions arise regarding Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who released Sandusky on $100,000 bail. The judge's former law firm listed her as a volunteer for The Second Mile. The Second Mile's CEO, Jack Raykovitz, resigns. November 14 -- In an interview with NBC's Bob Costas, Sandusky maintains he is innocent and denies he is a pedophile. Sandusky admits he has \"horsed around\" and \"done some of the things\" in the grand jury report, but says the only thing he did wrong was having \"showered with kids.\" Amendola calls Sandusky \"a big, overgrown kid.\" November 15 -- The Morning Call newspaper of Allentown, Pennsylvania, reports that McQueary wrote in an e-mail to a former classmate that he helped stop the 2002 assault and talked with police about it. \"I did stop it, not physically, but made sure it was stopped when I left that locker room,\" McQueary wrote.", "reference": "Penn State's football coach and president have lost their jobs .\nJerry Sandusky maintains that he is innocent .\nAllegations made in 1998 sparked a multiyear investigation ."}

Religious map of America: This is a visualization of data showing how many people attend church once a week . According to a survey by Gallup, 51 per cent of Utahns attend church at least once a week. The figures are likely a result of the fact that 59percent of the state self-identifies as Mormon, the faith that boasts higher levels of church attendance than any other religion in the US. The South owes its high level of church attendance to sizable black and Protestant populations, the study authors report.

{"id": 15183, "article": "DICTATORS' DINNERS . by Victoria Clark & Melissa Scott . (Gilgamesh Publishing £14.95) How many cookery books do you have? Lots? More than lots? An absolutely ridiculous number? Power-hungry: Ugandan tyrant Idi Amin . The problem is that there’s always one more that you have to have, even when you think you have collected the set. Dictators’ Dinners is subtitled A Bad Taste Guide To Entertaining Tyrants, and if there’s even the smallest chance of you having to feed Robert Mugabe or Kim Jong-Un one evening, you are going to need it on your shelf. Victoria Clark and Melissa Scott have approached their task with great clarity and simplicity. They profile 26 dictators, all from the 20th century, from Hitler and Mussolini in Europe, to Pol Pot in the East and ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier in the West. They describe their culinary preferences, and then give us the recipe for one of their favourite dishes. Rarely, if ever, have the depths of human depravity and haute cuisine been so stylishly combined in a single book. Stalin enjoyed long, severely alcoholic meals: when he referred to ‘a bite to eat’, he was usually talking about a six-hour feast, cooked by his favourite chef, Vladimir Putin’s grandfather. After one such snack, Marshal Tito vomited in his jacket sleeve; after another, Nikita Khrushchev was discovered to have wet his bed. Hitler was, as we know, a vegetarian, but more because he had a tender concern for animals than because he didn’t like the taste. On several occasions in the Thirties, he wolfed down fledgling pigeon stuffed with tongue, liver and pistachio nuts, and reportedly remarked that there was ‘nothing better than a liver dumpling’. He had 15 food-tasters, and only if none of them had dropped dead within 45 minutes of tasting a dish was it deemed safe for the Fuhrer. He must have eaten a lot of lukewarm food. How did paella become Spain’s national dish? Because it was thought to be General Franco’s favourite, so no Madrid restaurant could afford to leave it off the menu, just in case he popped in for lunch. Nicolae Ceausescu travelled with a mobile laboratory to analyse any food he was offered. If it hadn’t been screened and approved, he shovelled everything he was served at formal banquets straight on to the floor and kicked it as far away from him as possible. Saddam Hussein had 20 palaces, and kitchen staff at each of them prepared three meals a day for him whether he was there or not. He had his eldest son beaten up and thrown in jail for clubbing one of his food‑tasters to death. His usual breakfast was camel milk with bread and honey. After Hussein was captured in 2003, a nearly empty box of Bounty bars was found in his hideout. Colonel Gaddafi liked camel milk, too, but it may have been the cause of his legendary flatulence. On a visit to his tent in 2004, Tony Blair was advised not to accept a glass, lest he be similarly afflicted. Hastings Banda of Malawi favoured mopane worms, the large caterpillars of the emperor moth, especially when dried and eaten as a snack like crisps. Both Emperor Bokassa of the Central African Republic and Idi Amin of Uganda were rumoured to eat human flesh. Amin denied it: ‘It’s too salty for me.’ Instead he ate up to 40 oranges a day. One state banquet he hosted included bee larvae, green bush crickets, cicadas, flying ants and locusts. (Wash your crickets thoroughly and fry them with a little onion and garlic, with salt and pepper to taste.) Mao Tse-tung was a chronic insomniac who regularly took sleeping pills before dinner and fell asleep while he was eating, leaving attendants to fish any remaining food from his mouth. Ferdinand Marcos’s shoe-crazed wife Imelda, flying to Rome in their private plane, ordered the pilot to turn back because they had forgotten to bring cheese. According to his sushi chef, Korea’s Kim Jong-Il ‘enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing’. Maybe the most serious foodie dictator, though, was Fidel Castro, who was extolling the virtues of plain, fresh ingredients decades before Jamie Oliver was born.

Drones are used for lethal and non-lethal purposes: they can track drug smugglers, monitor borders and search for earthquake victims, and environmentalists use them to catch illegal whalers and loggers. But hundreds of drones have crashed in the last 14 years with documents uncovered by the Washington Post that show many catastrophes have been narrowly averted, often by a few feet, or a few seconds, or pure luck. Military drones have slammed into homes, farms, runways, highways, waterways and, in one of the most serious accidents an Air Force C-130 Hercules transport plane collide with a drone in midair. The driving force behind the most sophisticated drones remains the military, who use them for spying and killing. Their proliferation has led to thousands of deaths, the disruption of entire communities and increased political instability. In August 2011, the enormous transport place was descending towards Forward Operating Base Sharana, in eastern Afghanistan when suddenly it crashed into the drone. 'Holy s**t!' yelled the Hercules’s navigator, 'We got hit by a UAV! Hit by a UAV!' The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was being flown remotely by a crew on the ground and smashed into the cargo plane’s left wing between two propellers. Jet fuel came pouring out of the wing. Luckily the crew of the Hercules were able to shut down an engine and landed within two minutes of the accident happening. Scroll down for video...

Richard Wageman operates a Predator from a ground-control station in Afghanistan on Oct. 25, 2008. A week later, he was the pilot of a Predator that crashed into a U.S. military base. The precise cause of the crash was undetermined . The impact left an enormous hole in planes' wing. About 50 seconds later, the drone operator came across the radio to inform the control tower he had lost track of his aircraft. The tower was able to set him straight. 'We had a, ah, C-130, um, that hit a UAV. I’m suspecting that it’s yours.' The official finding of what caused the crash was censored. Some of the documents obtained by the Washington Post indicate the air-traffic controller was at least partly blamed. Military officials said there has been only one other case of a midair drone collision, involving a helicopter and a small, hand-launched drone in Iraq a decade ago but there have been more plenty of other incidents on the ground. In one accident in Afghanistan, armed Predator drones crashed near residential areas in the city of Jalalabad twice in the space of six months. The first time, the drone smashed into a housing complex. The second was into a row of shipping containers. The military paid compensation to those who were affected. Mistake: An Afghan housing compound that was destroyed in another U.S. military drone crash in Jalalabad later that year . U.S. navy sailors and Filipino soldiers retrieve a drone after it had crashed into the sea off the.. southern Philippines city of Zamboanga . On another occasion, a drone was slammed into a 17,000 foot mountain because the 'pilot' was distracted by storm clouds. Maintenance of the drones has also been a cause of some accidents. A broken propeller downed one of the machines. In other instances a drone was flown by an inexperienced officer who forgot to turn the stabilizer on (or perhaps unforgivably, turned it off!) The unmanned aircraft took a nose dive soon after takeoff - and it was all caught on camera. Part of the reasons for so many accidents was the design of the Predator drone. It had only one engine, one alternator, one propeller. If any of those parts failed, the plane would come down. Collision: In one of the more shocking incidents, a drone flew into the wing of a C-130 Hercules military transport plane. The plane was just minutes from touching down,m but it could have resulted in a very serious accident . In September 2004 armed insurgents are holding parts of a US Army remote controlled drone. The US military cited mechanical failure as the most likely cause of the crash . Technology: The Predator's infrared camera can identify a human from 10,000ft in the air .

They bought the 38in-long Raven which fits in a rucksack and can be launched by throwing it into the air. They invested in the 27ft-long Predator with its Hellfire missiles, and later the more powerful Reaper version.

Then there is the Vulture. Solar panels cover its massive 400ft wingspan and enable it to stay in the air for up to five years. Boeing has already produced a prototype for its Phantom Ray drone, roughly the size of a fighter jet, which flies itself. Since the drone program began, the Air Force has acquired 269 Predators. Going nowhere: More than 400 large U.S. military drones have crashed in major accidents around the world since 2001, a record of calamity that exposes the potential dangers of throwing open American skies to drone traffic .

An off-duty police officer shot dead while tackling a psychotic gunman has been named the bravest officer in England and Wales. Pc Ian Dibell, 41, was hit at point blank range as he tried to stop Peter Reeve, 64, gunning down his neighbours. Just minutes earlier the paranoid gunman fired seven times at his neighbour and his girlfriend in the communal hallway of their home. Pc Ian Dibell, left, who has been posthumously given a national bravery award . after he was shot dead when he tried to wrestle a weapon from deranged . gunman  Peter Reeve, right . The Essex officer’s self-sacrifice was honoured at the Police Bravery Awards, organised by the Police Federation of England and Wales. Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May joined dozens of police officers at the annual event in Central London. Among them were frontline officers who tackled armed robbers, rescued people from burning buildings and dived in freezing water to save drowning children. Mr Cameron said it is ‘humbling’ to read the extraordinary acts of heroism undertaken by officers in the line of duty. ‘Every single day, around our country, the police put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe,’ he said. ‘Without the rule of law, there is no freedom worth its name – and it is right that we recognise the work of those who do so much to uphold it.’ ‘Britain’s police are the best in the world, ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things.’ Theresa May honoured Pc Dibell at the London event . The awards come during a tense week . for relations between the police and the Government amid further . fall-out from ‘Plebgate’ Andrew Mitchell affair. Mr Cameron said his Tory party . colleague, who rowed with officers at the gates of Downing Street . deserves an apology over his treatment by three senior police . representatives. Pc Dibell was killed in an extraordinary confrontation a short distance from his home in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. The . officer walked out of his home to see Reeve chasing his neighbour in . his car while firing a pistol at him through the windscreen. Grabbing his warrant card to put himself on duty, Pc Dibell ran towards the car and dived through the driver’s side window. Witnesses . described hearing a loud bang before the officer fell to the road, . clutching his chest. He died at the scene from his injuries. Reeve then ran over his neighbour – who escaped with minor injuries – and crashed his car before travelling to a village graveyard where he turned the gun on himself. Mrs May said: ‘Ian Dibell’s death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. ‘Pc Dibell was off-duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm’s way. ‘His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world.’ Steve Williams, who leads the Police Federation, said:  ‘For every act of courage and bravery recognised here today there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised. ‘Officers put others’ lives before their own.  Sadly, as our winner’s story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. ‘Pc Ian Dibell was a valiant team player, his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life – always putting others before himself.’ :: Merseyside Pcs Nathan Jackman and Peter Stevens who tackled a violent knifeman after he attacked a man and a woman. :: Off-duty Pc Sara Widdrington, from North Yorkshire, who fearlessly tackled a gunman in a local store while shopping with her son. :: West Midlands Pcs Stephen Fletcher and Rory Stuart-Knill who were ambushed by a masked gang of up to 40 people armed with petrol bombs during the 2011 riots. :: Pc Martin Bentley, of Norfolk who pursued and caught a violent armed wife-beater despite being stabbed. :: Pc Alun Morgan, of Dyfed Powys Police, who dived into freezing quarry waters to rescue a drowning 15-year-old boy. :: Pc Nicholas French, of Gloucestershire, who single-handedly tackled a man armed with a knife who was trying to kill his wife in a garage. :: Met Pcs Stephen Barker, Thomas Harding, Shumal Haque, Alastair Hinchliff and Andrew Robb who suffered horrific injuries when they confronted a deranged knifeman in a butcher.", "reference": "Pc Ian Dibell died while tackling gunman who was shooting his neighbours .\nPrime Minister and Home Secretary attend annual event in London .\nDavid Cameron describes national bravery awards as 'humbling'"}
{"id": 15186, "article": "(CNN) -- So is this the \"new normal\"? That's the question I keep hearing as people try to comprehend the tragedy at the Boston Marathon and its chaotic aftermath. The answer is yes -- in more ways than you might think. I don't mean that we're supposed to get used to explosions, school shootings and other threats arising seemingly randomly and without warning. But we should accept that the old ways of understanding and responding to conflicts and threats no longer apply. In an always-on, post-narrative age, 24-hour cable and Internet news and Twitter feeds offer a steady stream of opportunities for panic and misinformation. We have a suspect; no, we don't; yes, we do. The school is on lockdown; no, it's not. False alarms are still alarms, after all. It's like we are all living in newsrooms, or as 911 operators or air-traffic controllers, for all the emergency interruptions and bulletins we navigate practically every hour. Then consider the equally unnerving limbo we endure once there's nothing new to report. The stakes are too high to return to regular programming, so we just sit there, poised on high alert along with the police and journalists. This time, it was flashing blue lights and the search for a suspect. Before that, it was the live feed of Deepwater Horizon in the corner of the screen for weeks, belching oil into the sea. Whether interruptive or chronic, the anxiety keeps pouring in. We live in a state of \"present shock.\" That was the week from hell . And even if network anchors still had the authority they once did, they would not be able construct a satisfying story around the onslaught of neverending news. When the journalists cheered as the police caught the marathon bombings suspect in the boat, it seemed that they were mostly relieved at reaching a definitive conclusion to a neverending news cycle. One news anchor actually declared \"justice won\" as she was at last permitted to cut to commercial. It rang false, because there's no genuine finality anymore. The story just doesn't end. Nor does the anxiety. For it's not so much a matter of responding to a particular crisis, threat or tragedy but of coping with the persistent flow of urgency itself. Some of the unease we feel with the Boston bombings comes from the nagging sense that we have no way of gauging where we are in the arc of violence. Is this the beginning of a new series of attacks, a rare event like the Oklahoma City bombing or part of some greater conspiracy yet to be revealed? Of course, none of the usual narratives apply, for we no longer live in a world with beginnings, middles and ends. That quaint structure went out with the Industrial Age and the moon shot. We no longer design career paths; we no longer invest in the future. We occupy; we freelance; we trade derivatives. Everything happens in the now. Even terror. While there are certainly groups such as al Qaeda with political goals and a modicum of organization, for every plotted attack with strategic goals, there are many more that arise haphazardly, randomly -- by either sympathizers, copycats or mentally ill nihilists with no political justification whatsoever. Boston's week of terror . We're no longer fighting enemies in the normal sense. We cannot begin a war on terrorism and then declare victory when we're done. We can't stick a flag in it and call it won. No, the challenges of a post-Industrial society are less like conquests with clear endpoints than they are steady-state concerns. Oil is spilling. The climate is changing. Terrorists are plotting. Crises are never quite solved for the future so much as managed in the present. But accepting the essentially plotless and ongoing nature of crisis needn't compromise our ability to respond appropriately and effectively. In fact, by freeing ourselves from the obsolete narratives we used to rely on, we can begin to recognize the patterns in the apparent chaos. We may not get answers to rally around or satisfyingly dramatic finales, but neither will we need to invent compelling, false stories to motivate ourselves into action. In a world where crises are constant and perpetual, we might as well begin to develop more sustainable approaches to solving them in real time, rather than once and for all. Life goes on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.", "reference": "Douglas Rushkoff: New normal is constant info stream; we don't really know how to respond .\nHe says terror attack coverage kept us in state of unending anxiety with little understanding .\nHe says new era of 24/7 crises offers steady-state concerns rather than ones with endpoint .\nRushkoff: We might as well develop sustainable approaches to solving crises in real time ."}

Over 80% of households in Bermuda were without power, according to a local newspaper, the Royal Gazette, which has reported no deaths, injuries or major damage due to the storm. A tropical storm a week earlier had knocked out power to nearly as many customers, the Gazette reported.

Jon Schultz, who monitors a number of 'disease domains' from his home in Las Vegas, bought Ebola.com in 2008 and now believes he can sell it for $150,000. The businessman also owns birdflu.com and H1N1.com, as well a domain for the deadly mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya and another for the Ebola-like Marburg virus. He paid $13,500 for his Ebola domain four years ago and has been waiting for the moment to sell. Scroll down for video . The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa . 'Ebola.com would be a great domain for a pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine or cure, a company selling pandemic or disaster-preparedness supplies, or a medical company wishing to provide information and advertise services,' Mr Schultz told CNBC in an emailed statement. 'There could be many other applications as well. With so many people concerned about the disease, any advertisement referring people to Ebola.com should get an excellent response.' In an interview with the Washington Post, Mr Schultz said he felt that a six figure sum was more than reasonable for Ebola.com. 'According to our site meter, we're already doing 5,000 page views per day just by people typing in Ebola.com to see what's there,' he said. 'We're getting inquiries every day about the sale of it. I have a lot of experience in this sort of domain business, and my sense is that $150,000 is reasonable.' Mr Schultz, who also owns terror.com, PotassiumIodide.com and fukushima.com, appeared untroubled about the issue of making money from a human tragedy. The World Health Organization called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' 'But you could say the same thing about doctors,' Schultz told the Washington Post. 'They can become very well-off treating very sick patients. 'Besides we have sacrificed a couple of thousands in parking page income to put up links about Ebola on the site. And people can also donate to Doctors Without Borders at the site.' The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa since an outbreak that began in March. The World Health Organization  called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'. The risks of failing to contain Ebola in West Africa have come into sharp focus in the United States after the first patient diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, died last week. Erica Ollman Saphire, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus using 'crowdfunding' on the internet . Mr Schultz told the Washington Post he wants to sell the domain soon because he is worried something may 'ameliorate' the outbreak, diminishing Ebola's news value and the value of the domain. 'Ebola is either something that could become more of a problem, or it's something that could ameliorate and not be a big news story for that much longer,' he said. But the entrepreneur still has other domain's to fall back on should Ebola.com lose its value. 'Our domain, birdflu.com, is worth way more than Ebola.com. We're definitely holding onto that one for the event,' he said, referring to an outbreak he believes could be far bigger than Ebola. ZMappwas used to treat aid worker Dr. Kent Brantly (pictured). An appeal is hoping to raise money to speed up the research into the drugs . 'That one's airborne and Ebola would never go airborne in the United States like bird flu can.' In California, a different individual has also turned to the internet to raise money. But rather than capitalizing on the outbreak immunologist Erica Ollman Saphire is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus. The professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping that Internet 'crowdfunding' will help provide the extra money needed to speed up the research. She is in charge of an international consortium developing the new anti-Ebola drugs that helped formulate the experimental ZMapp serum that used to treat two American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia and recovered. Dr. Saphire posted an appeal on the Crowd Rise website  seeking at least $100,000 in contributions for purchasing equipment that will allow researchers to more quickly analyze blood samples of antibodies from survivors of the hemorrhagic fever. The appeal has so far raised nearly $17,500 in donations. The Scripps-led consortium was established with a $28 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, but the rapidly growing scope of its work has placed additional demands on limited resources. Specimens are being sent to Dr. Saphire's lab from around the world, 'but the number of samples outpaces the ability of her current equipment to process them', the website said in a message. ZMapp is a mix of three antibodies designed to bind to proteins of the Ebola virus, preventing it from replicating and triggering the immune response of infected cells. The compound was tested in monkeys, but there were no human trials of the serum before it was rushed to Atlanta to treat U.S. aid workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol after they became infected in Liberia in July. Both were ultimately cured, but doctors are unsure whether the ZMapp actually helped them.", "reference": "Jon Schultz monitors several 'disease domains' from his home in Las Vegas .\nPaid $13,500 for Ebola domain in 2008 and was waiting for moment to sell .\nWants to sell soon as he is worried something may 'ameliorate'  outbreak .\nDr Erica Ollman Saphire is hoping internet can help raise funds to find cure .\nShe leads the group developing drugs that helped formulate  ZMapp serum .\nSo far the doctor has raised close to $17,500 using Crowd Rise campaign ."}

But the research states that it is actually the opinion of friends, family and coworkers that matter the most. Some 44 per cent of women said this would influence their decision of what to buy.

Influence: Celebrities may boost product sales, but we trust friends, family and co-workers the most . Research: When it comes to selling power, celebrity endorsements give brands a massive boost, however, the infographic collated by Feel Unique also shows that brand loyalty is crucial . While 20 per cent said they would reply on online reviews, and just five per cent said they would go by purely the celebrity face of the product. Brush of luck: Women spend an avergsr . Not only do women have an average of 54 . items in their make-up bag - from more than 12 countries they have travelled to - . the total cost of her collection is £512. Furthermore, women will spend a whopping £100,000 on cosmetics over her lifetime, which equates to £40 a week and £2,000 a year. Men aren't that far behind: The average 30-year-old male spends £100 a month on grooming products and treatments, according to a survey by Debenhams. The same study found men in their 40s tend to spend £70 a month of grooming. FeelUnique.com, which created the infographic, collated surveys from the likes of OnePoll, Bionsen, the Daily Mail, Cosmopolitan and Vogue. They also found that 57 per cent of women would rather break up with their boyfriend than break away from their make-up bag. Two thirds of women have admitted to bulk-buying cosmetics in a bid to find the best product to suit them - even if they rarely or never actually use the product. Others said they simply enjoyed splurging on beauty buys because it gave them 'great joy'. The illustration looked in particular at what makes a beauty product iconic. The found that in order for a product to reach this status, it must have 'unique appeal' and the consumer must feel an 'emotional bond' toward it. It also needs to have 'credibility for repeat purchase'. Beauty buys: From gathering various British surveys, Feel Unique found the most iconic beauty products to be Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream and L'Oreal Elnett Hairspray, amongst others .

A 'greedy and dishonest' stadium manager at Birmingham City FC who invented imaginary stewards to cover Premier League matches has been jailed for conning the club out of £45,000. Scheming Peter Smith, 63, fleeced thousands while working for the Blues by putting his family on the payroll and inventing 'ghost' stewards over a three year period. A court heard the fraudster added his wife, sons and daughter-in-in law to the payroll at St Andrews between December 2009 and April 2012. Former Birmingham City FC employee Peter Smith was jailed for conning the club out of £45,000 . He also made up another imaginary steward - by the name of Paul Knowles - and paid those wages into his account to help clear debts and his mortgage. Birmingham Crown Court heard the club were alerted to the suspicious transactions during an internal audit in April 2012, the year after they were relegated to the Championship. They contacted West Midlands Police who launched an investigation and found payments had been made to staff who had never carried out their stadium duties. Specialist fraud investigators probed the club's payroll and uncovered a number of false employment documents. They also found Smith's wife had never even set foot inside the football stadium, while his two sons and daughter-in-law were on the payroll despite not having any steward training and qualifications. Smith, from Perton near Wolverhampton, West Midlands, admitted fraud by abuse of position and was yesterday jailed for 18 months. A court heard the fraudster added his wife, sons and daughter-in-in law to the payroll at St Andrews between December 2009 and April 2012 . Detective Constable Catherine Dell, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'This was a fraud driven by greed and Smith's frustration that, at the age of 63, he still had a sizeable mortgage. 'Smith began by putting his wife, using her maiden name, on the books and paying wages into his bank account. 'He clearly thought it was easy money and became more audacious by inventing an employee called Paul Knowles and charging the club for steward services. 'This was a blatant abuse of position: he put family members down on attendance lists and signed off their time sheets, including overtime, even though there's no evidence they did any work at the club. 'We scrutinised the payroll for up to 70 matches and corporate club events and when we put the evidence to Smith he was left with no option but to admit the fraud.' Smith's assets have since been frozen by police who will look to recover the stolen cash through the Proceeds of Crime Act. Angela Millington, senior prosecutor for West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), added: 'Peter Smith was employed by Birmingham City Football Club as their Safety Officer, a job which involved the club putting a lot of trust in him as he had the responsibility of ensuring the safety and welfare of fans and club officials. 'However, Smith grossly exploited his position of trust and abused his senior position in order to dishonestly receive over £45,000 which was used to enrich himself and his family. 'He exploited the club's employment practices for greed and self-importance, but he has paid the penalty for his abuse of the club's trust. A Birmingham City FC spokesman, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome. 'The club would like to thank West Midlands Police and the CPS for their thorough investigation. 'This case was prompted by an internal investigation by management staff at the club and no stone was left unturned. 'It is particularly pleasing all of the hard work, dedication and professionalism carried out behind the scenes have resulted in today's judgement.'", "reference": "Peter Smith, 63, fleeced thousands by putting his family on the payroll .\nAdmitted fraud by abuse of position and was jailed for 18 months ."}

A lawyer beaten to a pulp by four masked men inside his £2 million London home said he could not stop thinking about his wife and daughter despite the horrendous nature of his injuries. Speaking for the first time since the attack, Paul Kohler from Wimbledon, south west London said he was almost blinded within moments of the attack, but tried to land his own punches to protect his family. Academic Mr Kohler revealed the gang, who spoke with an Eastern European accent, kept asking 'Where’s the money?' during the home invasion. He said: . 'The first punch in the hall took my eye out, I thought I had lost the . eye at that stage because it stopped functioning. 'But I just kept thinking of my wife and daughter and her boyfriend upstairs. 'They got me on the floor but I managed to stand up and at one stage and trade blows with them.' Mr Kohler told the Evening Standard: 'I got a few blows in, but these were thumps like I never had in my life - they could really punch.' Police are now investigating whether the attack was linked to a cabaret bar Mr Kohler, 55, owns in central London. Detectives . searching two men who assaulted an academic and bar owner inside his . own home on Monday have released new CCTV footage of one of the . suspects. Father-of-four Paul Kohler, 55, was beaten by four masked men at his home in Wimbledon, south west London at 10pm on Monday. Police are currently searching for two men in connection with the assault, who escaped from the scene on foot. Two other men were arrested after the attack and have been charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated burglary. Police investigating the violent burglary want to speak to this man who was seen moments after the attack . The man can be clearly seen removing surgical gloves as he walked through Wimbledon Theatre car park . The suspect, pictured, looked anxious as he walked through the car park according to detectives who have scrutinised the CCTV footage . Mr Kohler and Samatha, centre, married at Jesus College Cambridge in April, with their daughter acting as bridesmaids, from left, Eloise, Saskia, Paul, Samantha,  Bethany and Tamara . His brother, Marcus Kohler, a charity worker from Cambridge, said: 'Paul is an incredibly strong man. 'The vision in his left eye is coming back and doctors are confident his sight will improve. 'His face has been so swollen he hasn't been able to have surgery yet. 'The hospital were going to let him out yesterday but he's had to have a blood transfusion because his haemoglobin is so low. 'We just want to get him home again but I think he might stay now until surgery as the swelling is going down. 'He never lost consciousness so has been able to speak to his family in hospital. 'We are determined to get through this and not let what happened change us.. 'You can't help but be a bit paranoid now though. 'Samantha and his daughters are doing OK. It's been hard for us but we are not losing hope. 'He'll be OK eventually, we just need to find out how this happened and see those other two men arrested.' One . of the remaining suspects fled down King's Road towards Wimbledon town . centre. He was spotted crossing the car park of Wimbledon Theatre a few . minutes after the attack. It is not known which direction the final man went. The third suspect removed 'surgical gloves' worn during the attack as he crossed through the theatre's car park. The two remaining men are believed to be from Eastern Europe, possibly Poland and are in their 20s or 30s. Officers are also seeking information on a silver-coloured Volkswagen convertible which may have been used by the gang. Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, of Merton Burglary Squad, said: 'This new piece of CCTV is crucial in the identification of one of the outstanding suspects, and we are calling to anyone who recognises this man to come forward. 'It is my firm belief that this man and his other outstanding associate, would have been stained with blood spatter from the violent attack inside the house. 'Both were also wearing white surgical gloves when they fled. Whilst they attempted a quick exit, I'm sure that members of the public would have seen them. 'The victim currently remains in hospital and is awaiting surgery to an extreme eye injury which has lead to the fracture of his socket. Police believe that passing motorists may have spotted one of the suspects, pictured, fleeing the scene . Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan believes that the men will have been covered in 'blood spatter' The attackers repeatedly asked Mr Kohler where he kept the money during Monday's burglary . Detective Inspector O'Sullivan continued: 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough and we believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 'We continue to appeal for information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. 'However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. 'Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.' Officers believe the suspect fled from King's Road and through the car park of the New Wimbledon Theatre . Mr Kohler, left, was at home with his wife Samantha, right, and daughter Eloise, centre at the time of the attack . Two men have so far appeared in court in connection with the incident. Polish nationals Pawel Honc, 23, of no fixed abode and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, from Tooting in south London both appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court where they were charged with aggravated burglary and grevious bodily harm. Both were remanded to reappear at Kingston Crown Court on August 27. At the time of the attack Mr Kohler and his wife Samantha were playing a board game with their daughter Eloise and her boyfriend. Moments before the gang approached, Eloise and the boyfriend went to her room, where they locked themselves in as they heard the shouting and dialed 999. Earlier Detective Inspector O'Sullivan described the attack as the most brutal assault he has seen in more than 20 years of policing. Detectives believe Monday night’s robbery – as the family played a board game – was well-planned and targeted but are perplexed by the motive behind the ultra-violent attack. One line of inquiry is that Mr Kohler, who is head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, is the victim of mistaken identity or that the gang simply struck at the wrong house. Mr . Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Central London with his wife . Samantha, centre, and business partner Gordon Anderson. The popular . venue is located in a converted underground toilet frequented by Oscar . Wilde . Mr Kohler is part owner of The Cellar Bar, pictured,  which is located in a former underground gents' toilet . DI O'Sullivan said: 'The victim and his family are distraught and they cannot understand why they were targeted in this way. We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.' He will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead. Mr Kohler’s wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as ‘cowardly and wicked’ and praised her husband’s bravery. The couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids. Miss MacArthur, 50, said: ‘This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat him for no reason?’ ‘He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating him up and he didn’t stop. He fought the whole way and I’m sure if he hadn’t it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.’ Mr Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Aldwych, central London, with Gordon Anderson, who told the Daily Telegraph that he had no idea why his colleague was set upon. He told the newspaper: 'Paul is a beautiful human being. I can't understand how anyone could do this to him.' The 52-year-old explained that the bar was part of the London cabaret and drag seen and that the venture was 'successful and fun'. Asked whether he believed the assault may have been linked to the bar in some way, he added: 'I have no idea. That is a matter for the police.'

The North's Association for Human Rights Studies said the report would counter the 'lies and fabrications' made by unspecified 'hostile forces' about the rights situation in the isolated state. North Korea is regularly listed among the world's worst human rights offenders in indexes compiled by governments, UN agencies and rights watchdogs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks to officials at a machine plant in Pyongyang. North Korea is to publish its own report saying its human rights record is 'bright and rosy' In one of the most comprehensive reports to date, a UN inquiry into the North's rights record published its findings in February and detailed a wide range of systemic abuses including murder, enslavement and torture. The commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity and suggested they could be placed before the International Criminal Court. The report likened North Korea's regime to Nazism and called for the International Criminal Court to close political prison camps. The use of systematic torture, starvation, and killings is akin to punishments ordered under Adolf Hitler, the report stated. 'The gravity, scale and nature of these violations revealed a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,' it said. However, North Korea rejected the report as a 'sheer fabrication' invented by the United States and its allies. Kim Jong-Un's North Korea is to publish report saying its human rights record for the future is looking good . The UN commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity . The country is estimated to have 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in its sprawling gulag system . A spokesman from the North's rights association said its own report would help people 'do away with their prejudice and misunderstanding' about the rights situation in the country. 'The report will show the true picture of the people of the (North) dynamically advancing towards a brighter and rosy future,' he said in an interview with the North's official KCNA news agency. No release date was given but the spokesman said the report would be published in 'the near future'. The impoverished but nuclear-armed North has been ruled for more than six decades by the Kim family dynasty that has maintained power with an iron fist and zero tolerance for political dissent. The country is estimated to have 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in its sprawling gulag system. Those who are caught crossing the border to China in a bid to flee poverty and repression at home are often sent to jail or executed. In February, the UN's commission of inquiry into human rights in North Korea published a damning report detailing human rights abuses committed by the country's leadership against its own people. They compared the scale of the abuse to the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Michael Kirby, the chair of the report, personally wrote to Kim Jong-un to warn him that he could face trial at The Hague for his personal culpability in crimes against humanity. Brutal: Life in the totalitarian North Korean camps shown by a former guard who took this photo . The UN's Commission on human rights in North Korea gathered evidence for more almost a year. It said there was compelling evidence of torture, execution and arbitary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and a lack of free thought. Michael Kirby, an Australian retired judge, who was chairman of the panel, said: 'The commission wishes to draw your attention that it will therefore recommend that the United Nations refer the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [the formal name for North Korea] to the international criminal court to render accountable all those, including possibly yourself, who may be responsible for the crimes against humanity.' At the time of the report was published, Mr Kirby said there were 'many parallels' between the evidence he heard and crimes committed by the Nazis during the Second World War. This complex known as known as Hwasong camp covers 200 square miles and is home to 20,000 prisoners . In one case a prison camp inmate had been given the task of burning the bodies of those who had starved to death before the remains were used as fertiliser. Mr Kirby said: 'Now the international community does know. There will be no excusing a failure of action because we didn't know. It's too long now. The suffering and the tears of the people of North Korea demand action.' The report was 400-pages long and concluded there was overwhelming evidence that crimes against humanity have been and are still being committed. The inquiry also found 'an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. It reported on the vast network of secret prison camps known as kwanliso where hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are believed to have died. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners are still held and their cases are often kept secret. The report says: 'Their families are not informed of their fate or whereabouts. Persons accused of political crimes therefore become victims of enforced disappearance. 'Making the suspect disappear is a deliberate feature of the system that serves to instil fear in the population.' If a woman becomes pregnant by a Chinese man, newborn babies are often drowned or the mother is forced to have an abortion. The report also said the state often uses food as a means of control over the population. 'It has prioritised those whom the authorities believe to be crucial in maintaining the regime over those deemed expendable', the report said.", "reference": "North Korea said its report would counter 'lies and fabrications'\nCountry regularly listed among the world's worst human rights offenders .\nUN detailed a range of abuses including murder, enslavement and torture .\nCommission concluded that violations constituted crimes against humanity .\nNorth Korea rejected report as a 'sheer fabrication' invented by the U.S."}

Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, has been held in custody since June 30 for 'propaganda against the regime' after trying to watch a men's volleyball match, which women in Iran are banned from attending. The group of fellow women's rights campaigners she was  with took this photograph when they were prevented from entering the Azadi stadium, in Tehran. This is the photograph Iranian authorities claim justifies their detention of Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, (circled) Miss Ghavami, pictured with her mother, Susan Moshtaghian, 49, who has also gone on a hunger strike in protest against her daughter's detention in Iran . Miss Ghavami was questioned for four hours after being arrested for trying to enter the stadium in the Iranian capital. She had believed she could watch the match because reports had suggested the restriction on women mingling with male spectators at sports facilities had been relaxed. The 25-year-old graduate from SOAS, part of the University of London, was released but rearrested days later when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station and officers discovered dual citizenship. Miss Ghavami was only told on September 23 that she was formally charged with ‘propaganda against the regime’ – a charge that carries a possible prison term of several years. Her case is due to be heard by Tehran’s notorious revolutionary court. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, from London, (above) has been refusing food in defiance of her detainment at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison where she has been held since her arrest in June for ‘propaganda against the regime’ To mark 100 days since she was jailed, Miss Ghavami has now gone on a hunger strike. Miss Ghavami’s mother, Susan Moshtaghian, 49, told the Guardian that she too had gone on hunger strike and was increasingly worried about her daughter’s condition. ‘I am extremely concerned about Ghoncheh’s health and life. I hold [the] authorities fully responsible for any harm inflicted on my daughter,’ she said. Ms Moshtaghian, from London, was allowed to visit her daughter for the first time in 19 days on Saturday. ‘She told me she has been on hunger strike since 1 October as objection to her uncertain conditions and 100 days of temporary custody with no basis,’ she said. ‘I am restless since I heard about this and I have also gone on hunger strike. I stayed silent for 82 days in the hope that my daughter comes back home safely. 'Now I am worried about her life and will not stop until she’s free.’ Miss Ghavami’s brother, Iman, 28, said his sister had lost weight since she has been imprisoned and was visibly thinner when her parents visited. He said he was 'extremely concerned' about her health. ‘People die from hunger strike. It’s a very serious situation and it’s been five days now,’ he said. Since her arrest, the London graduate has been allowed minimal contact with her family. The law graduate from SOAS, part of the University of London, has been held for 100 days after being arrested in June for trying to watch a men’s sports game in Tehran which women in Iran are banned from attending . A petition started by Mr Ghavami on the site Change.org has so far collected more than 528,000 signatures. David Cameron and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond have raised the matter with their Iranian counterparts. But as Iran does not recognise dual nationality, diplomatic efforts are limited. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, was questioned about Miss Ghavami’s detention on Christiane Amanpour’s CNN show in September. He said: ‘According to our laws [she is an Iranian citizen] only, we do not accept dual citizenship, but the bottom line is our aim is for the laws to be respected every step of the way.’ An FCO spokeswoman said: ‘We are concerned about the detention of Miss Ghoncheh Ghavami, a dual British-Iranian national in Iran. 'We are in touch with her family. We have raised our concerns with the Iranian government and asked for more information about her welfare and the charges against her.'

In the professional one-minute clip, soldiers for IS can be seen practicing hand-to-hand combat and completing fitness drills, was posted by the group on YouTube . In the video one man can be seen practicing with nunchucks while others sit around and watch him . The clip also shows of the group's vehicles, featuring soldiers exiting the back of an armoured truck and crawling underneath a tank . The fighters are shown marching in drill-like exercises, dragging tyres in fitness tests and crossing scramble nets, climbing walls and using monkey bars on an assault course. The men can be seen on marksmanship exercises, launching assaults from the back of an armoured personnel carrier and in a wood in full camouflage. They show off using nunchucks – a wooden handled weapon from the Far East - and demonstrate unarmed combat skills, and crawl along the ground as tanks pass over them. The video finishes with a shot of a bearded cameraman in a baseball cap, equipped with the latest digital camera, as he follows fighters on an exercise and words on the screen promise 'Part 2 coming soon.' Soldiers are seen rehearsing how to destroy a tank as it drives over the top of them (tank pictured right) Recruits are seen taking part in Western-style training exercises, such as abseiling down cliffs . The video ends with the ominous message that 'part 2' will be coming soon . The film is designed as a recruitment aid to show that the forces of a grouping called the Islamic Front are better trained and equipped that their rivals in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). According to Charles Lister of the analysts IHS Janes, the Islamic Front could have as many as 45,000 fighters under its command. It was formed last November as an umbrella group for a number of Islamist factions fighting in various cities in Syria including the Al-Tawhid Brigade, based in Aleppo, and a fundamentalist group called Ahrar ash-Sham. The video goes to great pains to show off the professional recording equipment being used by IS, including Hollywood-style camera rigs . The final shot of the video shows troops moving through the woods, before the shot comes to rest on a bearded man with a high-tech camera filming them . IS have made use of high quality footage before, such as the execution videos of James Foley and Steven Sotloff which drew international media attention . Initially the group pledged to work with the mainstream group the Free Syrian Army, but they raided warehouses run by the FSA in Atmeh weeks after they were formed, seizing equipment supplied by the West and leading to a suspension of supplies to the FSA by Britain and others. They have since reconciled with the FSA and are considered by Middle Eastern powers to be an essential bulwark against the rise of the more fanatical group, ISIS. However, demonstrating the complex nature of the opposition groups, they seek to establish a state ruled by shariah law and at least one senior member has professed to links with al-Qaeda.", "reference": "Video shows extremists training at so-called 'Black War Training Camp'\nSoldiers seen stalking through wood and leaping from armoured truck .\nProfessionally shot clip also shows off high-tech camera equipment ."}

Thousands of female munition factory workers began playing the beautiful game during World War One, but the Blyth Spartans Munitionettes from Northumberland played more beautifully than all the others. Taught to play by naval ratings on a local beach, the Blyth Spartans remained unbeaten throughout their two-year existence. Stars: The Blyth Spartans team of 1918, including Bella Raey who scored a hat-trick in the Munitionettes Cup . Star player: The Blyth Spartans top player was coalminer's daughter, Bella Raey . Their star centre-forward was Bella Raey, the daughter of a local coal miner, who scored 133 goals in one season, and even went on to play for England. The highlight of the female football calendar was a knock-out tournament called the Munitionettes Cup, held in 1918, which attracted 30 teams. The Blyth Spartans were the eventual winners, beating Bolckow-Vaughan of Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park in front of a crowd of 22,000. Bella Reay scored a hat-trick. But despite the women being almost as popular on the pitch as the men had been before the war, when the boys returned home, the munition factories closed and the teams disbanded. Several women tried to continue to play, but in 1921, the FA banned women's football at their grounds - bringing to an end a colourful chapter in women's sport which has long been overlooked. Now the story of the Blyth Spartans Munitionettes has been brought to life in a radio documentary for BBC Newcastle as part of a new series that explores the tales of the British women who kept the UK moving during World War One. The UK-wide project, World War One At Home, will tell more than 1400 powerful, fascinating and moving stories over the coming year across local, regional and national radio, television and online.

The Warrington-born dual champion will line up for the first time in the €5million Qatar Prix de L’Arc Triomphe on 6-1 second favourite Taghrooda confident there was an explanation for her only defeat behind Tapestry in the Yorkshire Oaks in August. The Liverpool-supporting rider will also be buoyed by a 2014 record which has seen Taghrooda provide him with wins in the Investec Oaks at Epsom and the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on his first rides in the pair of prestigious contests. Paul Hanagan has experience of riding Taghrooda, pictured at Ascot in August 2014 . Hanagan leaves the weighing room at Ascot in October 2014 . Taghrooda would become the first filly to win the Arc and King George in the same season and a more than satisfactory gallop last week at Newmarket’s Rowley Mile racecourse has convinced Hanagan that his John Gosden-trained mount is back in prime form. Hanagan said: ‘I never like to make excuses but she was just coming into season and that is pretty big. When I went for her she felt as if she just faltered. Newmarket did her the world of good. She rides like a colt and is built like one. It has been a wonderful season — to win the Arc would be the perfect end.’ Longchamp’s normally sparsely-populated lawns will be packed this afternoon with 60,000 spectators. About 5,000 Japanese among them will be hoping their trio — Just A Way, Gold Ship or Harp Star — can give them a first win after near-misses including second place for Orfevre for the last two years. The big worry for Hanagan, who landed the first Group One of his career at this meeting in 2010 with Richard Fahey’s Wootton Bassett in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere, is Taghrooda’s draw in wide stall 15. Treve won from there last year but she was the first to do so from a double-figure stall since Dalakhani (14) in 2003.

The sun shone at Longchamp yesterday and drying conditions are another negative in the argument that trainer Criquette Head-Maarek can turn around a disappointing season for 2013 winner Treve. Whether the narrow defeat by Cirrus Des Aigles in the Prix Ganay left its mark is debatable but the filly who was 2-1 to win back-to-back Arcs immediately 12 months ago is now 11-1 after other defeats at Royal Ascot, when she was injured, and last month’s Prix Vermeille. Treve is ridden by Thierry Jarnet not Frankie Dettori, leaving the Italian to ride Prix Foy winner Ruler of the World.

{"id": 15202, "article": "Before: Leanne Johnson pictured as a schoolgirl in a photograph released by her family . For Pamela Johnson, these pictures tell a story of almost unbearable tragedy. One shows her daughter Leanne as an angelic schoolgirl, smiling and full of hope for the future. The other shows the college student at 26, near-comatose on her bed after taking crack cocaine and heroin – the drugs that would take her life shortly after. Despite the harrowing impact of the images, Mrs Johnson, 67, wants them to be published in the hope that charting her daughter’s decline from happy child to hopeless addict will act as a warning to others of the dangers of drugs. An inquest this week heard how Miss Johnson, a trainee hairdresser, had desperately tried to end her habit and appeared on TV’s Jeremy Kyle Show to talk about her demons. But despite successfully ‘going clean’ after four months in rehab, she went on a secret drug binge when she returned home to Bolton. It would be her last. Her sister Melanie Gatis said: ‘She succeeded in kicking her habit and then embarked on a moment of madness which cost her life. ‘If her story saves one person’s life then Leanne has achieved some form of legacy.’ The Bolton inquest was told Miss Johnson came from a respectable family and had held down a number of jobs after studying at college. But her life began to fall apart when she turned 18 and began a relationship with a man who introduced her to drugs. She became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine – at one stage going through six bags of heroin every day and going missing for several weeks at a time. Another sister Lisa Stevenson told the inquest: ‘She used to just disappear and go and self-destruct but she would eventually come home.’ In May last year Miss Johnson contacted ITV’s Jeremy Kyle talk show in a ‘cry for help’ and was later offered a place on a rehab programme in Luton. At first it was a success and Mrs Johnson said she felt as if ‘I had got my daughter back’. ‘She said she never felt better and had never been happier,’ she added. After: Leanne is pictured under the influence of drugs; her family took these photographs to show her in a bid to shock her into changing her behaviour . Tragic: Leanne's family have released a series of old photographs of her  to warn against the dangers of drugs . Horror: These shocking images, also taken by Leanne's family, show how low she sank due to the addiction which eventually killed her . Help: Leanne went on the Jeremy Kyle Show in a bid to get her addiction under control . Weeping: But she vowed to kick drugs after going on the show and was subsequently sent to rehab . Rehab: Leanne's family praised the show's producers for helping her recover from addiction before she relapsed . But Miss Johnson lost her place on a second stint of the rehab when she broke the rules by drinking alcohol. Just eight days after returning home in September last year she was dead. To the bafflement of her family, Miss Johnson had a ‘blip’ and took a fatal overdose. Sadly, at the time she had been using her mobile phone to download an application form for a hairdressing course. Battle: Leanne, pictured left on a night out, struggled with addiction for eight years . Family: Leanne as a toddler with her mother, Pamela, in another snap from the family photo album . Together: Leanne with her mother, left, and one of her older sisters, right . Adorable: Leanne grew from a happy-go-lucky little girl into a young woman ravaged by drugs . Verdict: A coroner ruled that Leanne's died from misadventure and issued a warning about drug abuse . Her mother found her body in her bedroom along with drug paraphernalia by her side, including a syringe in an ashtray and a crack pipe in her handbag. Mrs Gatis, 43, said: ‘Leanne had a last-minute blip and we still don’t know why. We honestly thought we’d got our sister back.’ Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.", "reference": "Leanne Johnson came from a happy family but turned to drugs aged 18 .\nShe resorted to prostitution to fund her habit as she took heroin and crack .\nTrainee hairdresser went on Jeremy Kyle Show and was subsequently sent to rehab but kicked out shortly before her death .\nShe relapsed and was found dead of a heroin overdose in her bedroom ."}

A horse-mad bride chose her thoroughbred to be one of her bridesmaids at her wedding. Alex Wells, 28, was attended by her friend Lianna Bourne, 28, and her 17-year-old horse, Toffee, when she married Graham Sales in her childhood home in Nottinghamshire. Unlike Miss Bourne, Toffee had to stay outside the church during the service, but was waiting when the happy couple emerged from All Saints Church in Coddington, and took her part in the line-up for the official photographs. Mrs Sales, who grew up in Coddington and events competitively on her thoroughbred, said: 'Toffee is part of the family and is so important to me, I even asked her permission to get married.' Her husband, who judging by the photographs does not share perhaps quite the same passion for Toffee as his new bride, admitted he was 'definitely behind Toffee' in the pecking order.

Miss Bourne, of Kilmarnock, Scotland, said: 'Toffee took longer than me to get ready.  She was definitely in the spotlight.' The Reverend David Anderton, who led the wedding service, said an equine bridesmaid was a new one on him in a decade of marrying couples. He said: 'I have never seen any animal of any sort being a bridesmaid, but I was glad Alex didn't ask if she could bring her down the aisle - I was happy to have her in the churchyard.'

Syrian president Bashar Assad is attempting to crush an eight-month-old revolt against his autocratic rule which has led to violent protests across the country and thousands of deaths. It has now been reported that the government has outlawed the iPhone - which was created by Jobs as CEO of Apple - in a bid to prevent activists from using the popular device to post footage of violent protests on the internet. Crackdown: The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs holding up an Apple iPhone. The device has now been banned in Syria . The ban would no doubt anger Jobs' biological father Abdulfattah John Jandali who is a native Syrian and recently came out in support of protesters in a YouTube video. According to Times Live, the Lebanese website Al Nashara, said the ban had been issued by the Customs Department of the Syrian Finance Ministry. Wants change: Steve Jobs' biological father Abdulfattah John Jandali has now voiced his support for the Syrian pro-democracy activists . A statement by the department read: 'The authorities warn anyone against using the iPhone in Syria.' One Syrian activist, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the newspaper: 'It is enough for any tourist or guest visiting Syria to own an iPhone to be a spy suspect. 'Steve Jobs must be turning in his grave on learning that his iconic device is banned in his home country.' The U.N.'s top human rights official warned on Thursday that Syria has entered a state of civil war with more than 4,000 people dead and an increasing number of soldiers defecting from the army to take up arms against the president. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said the death toll for the revolt stands 'at 4,000 but really the information coming to us is that it's much more than that.' Almost all foreign media has been banned from Syria since the protests began in March. The Syrian government shut down the internet and 3G mobile networks in June in a bid to prevent protesters from communicating. Jobs' biological father Mr Jandali, who did not have a relationship with his famous son, recently expressed his support for the pro-democracy protesters in a YouTube video. Under-pressure: Syrian President Bashar Assad is attempting to crush an eight-month-old revolt against his autocratic rule . He said: 'I am in solidarity with the Syrian people. 'I reject the brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are committing against the innocent people in Syria. 'And because silence is participation in this crime, I declare my participation in the Syrian sit-in on YouTube.'

He only learned that Jobs was his son in 2005 - one year after the technology icon was first diagnosed with cancer.

'This might sound strange, though, but I am not prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to pick up the phone to call him,' Mr Jandali said. 'Steve will have to do that, as the Syrian pride in me does not want him ever to think I am after his fortune. 'Now I just live in hope that, before it is too late, he will reach out to me, because even to have just one coffee with him just once would make me a very happy man'.

{"id": 15206, "article": "(CNN) -- The men accused in the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old Indian woman were formally charged with murder, rape and kidnapping in a New Delhi court Thursday, a senior police official said. The attack on the woman, who died from her severe injuries last week, has appalled and enraged many Indians, prompting widespread debate over the way the country handles sexual assaults and the treatment of women in Indian society. Numerous protests have taken place, new laws have been proposed and senior lawyers in the court district where the accused men have been charged say they will not represent them. Police submitted charges against five suspects before a new fast-track court in Saket, a southern district of New Delhi, said Suman Nalwa, deputy police commissioner of a special unit for women and children. He said authorities were waiting for the outcome of a bone marrow test before deciding whether a sixth suspect in the attack, believed to be a minor, will be charged as a juvenile or an adult. 'She could have been me': Action urged after Delhi gang rape case . The results of the test, intended to determine the suspect's exact age, should come soon, Nalwa said. The trial will begin this week once all the evidence is gathered, he said. As well as counts of murder, kidnapping and rape, the men face charges including voluntarily causing harm during a robbery, armed robbery with murder, and destruction of evidence. If convicted, several of the offenses are punishable by death or life imprisonment. The victim, whose name has not been released, died Saturday in a Singapore hospital, where she received treatment after being airlifted from New Delhi. The men are accused of assaulting the woman and her male companion on a bus in the Indian capital on December 16, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, police said. The male companion was eventually discharged from a local hospital. iReport: 'I'm ashamed as a man' Protests, which have been taking place every day since the woman's death, continued Thursday in New Delhi. Authorities plan to seek the death penalty for the accused, CNN affiliate IBN reported, with many calls for the men to be hanged, including from the victim's family. If the sixth accused is confirmed to be a minor, he could be sent to a children's home for a maximum of three years, according to IBN. The 11 lawyers who make up the executive board of the Saket Bar Association on Wednesday vowed not to represent any of the accused assailants because of the nature of the crime. In addition, the bar association has appealed to its 7,000 members also to refrain from representing the accused, said the association's president, Rajpal Kasana. \"We are not taking this case on the grounds of humanity,\" he said. The boycott by the bar association does not mean the accused will not have lawyers. Attorneys from other districts or ones appointed by the court will likely fill that role. Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013 . The call for local lawyers to avoid defending the accused is unprecedented, but justified because \"everyone is emotionally attached to this case,\" Kasana said. Lawmakers are weighing a proposal to toughen the country's anti-rape law. Some have suggested a new law should be named after the woman, while others have said it's illegal to reveal her identity. The victim's father told IBN that he supported naming a new law after his daughter. \"All I ask is that the law is the toughest it can be,\" he said. \"The death penalty is compulsory for a crime so grave the assailants must be hanged. The courts must give these men the death penalty.\" Misogyny in India: We are all guilty . CNN iReporter Meera Vijayann, a consultant for a non-governmental organization from Bangalore, India, said sexual harassment is a daily problem for women -- but it was the horrific nature of the New Delhi attack and the brazenness of the alleged perpetrators that frightened so many people. Despite calls for harsher punishments for those who carry out such crimes, Vijayann feels only a change in attitudes and culture will truly bring about change. \"There is a sexist mindset, politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes, not go to parties ... if they make the laws how will it benefit us?\" she asked. \"People have to change the way they think.\" India's Supreme Court will hear a petition Thursday asking it to suspend all lawmakers who face charges for crimes against women. The petition was filed in the aftermath of the brutal gang rape, which sent thousands of outraged protesters to the streets for days. \"This unfortunate episode has galvanized the nation,\" said Jagdeep S. Chhokar, an official with the Association for Democratic Reforms, which tracks political candidates' criminal records. Chhokar said six Indian state lawmakers are facing rape charges in unrelated cases, and two people in the federal parliament are also facing charges of crimes against women that fall short of rape. The group says that in the past five years, political parties across India have nominated 260 candidates facing charges of crimes against women such as assault and outraging the modesty of a woman. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong, Aliza Kassim from Atlanta, and Sarah Brown contributed to this report from London.", "reference": "Police file charges against the accused men in a New Delhi court .\nThey are alleged to have raped a woman on a bus, leaving her with fatal injuries .\nThe victim's father says he supports naming a tougher anti-rape law after her .\nBar association leaders in the district where it happened urge lawyers not to take defendants' case ."}

'I was simply told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of . lads or whatever. Some I knew their fate, some I didn't.' Price was found by family members at her home on Wednesday night. A garda spokesman said her death is not being treated as suspicious. She also accused Mr Adams of sanctioning the Old Bailey court attack, in which one man died and more than 200 people were injured - 33 of whom were in Whitehall. Price - the former wife of Hollywood actor Stephen Rea - was part of the IRA unit that planted four car bombs outside the Old Bailey, as was her sister Marian. Two of the bombs exploded. The sisters and their gang were arrested as they tried to get back into Ireland. Price was . sentenced to life for the bombing but freed eight years later in 1981 because she was suffering from an eating disorder. History: Price had two sons with her ex-husband Hollywood actor Stephen Rea, pictured, who was one of the voices dubbed over that of Mr Adams during the 1980s broadcasting ban on him . Price, originally from Belfast, added that people who are informers ‘deserve to die’ and ‘that is . the Republican way’. Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price, pictured left at a civil rights demonstration near Belfast, joined the IRA with her sister Marian, pictured right, in the 1970s . She made the allegations . on the record to researchers working for Boston College in the U.S. The recordings were made on the basis . that they remain secret until the death of the 28 former IRA and Ulster . Volunteer Force terrorists who took part. But the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been battling to . recover the recordings as evidence as part of their investigation into the murder of Mrs McConville. A book based on recordings of two dead terrorists revealed that former IRA commander Brendan Hughes mentioned the ‘disappeared’ - people killed by the IRA and buried in secret graves. He made the allegation that high-profile murder victim Mrs McConville, who died in 1972, was killed by the ‘unknowns’ squad, claiming: ‘Gerry had control over this particular squad.’ Price said she gave interviews to Boston College to . ‘put Gerry Adams where he belonged’. Both Price and her 58-year-old sister, who has been imprisoned in Northern Ireland since 2011 after her licence was revoked, have been outspoken critics of the peace process. ‘I think the process should be . undermined,’ said Price. ‘I think the process should be destroyed in some . way and I think Gerry Adams deserves to admit to his part, in all of the . things that happened.’ Marion also named Mr Adams as the ‘officer commanding’ of the Belfast brigade of the IRA and claimed he asked for volunteers for the bombing campaign on mainland Britain. ‘Who sent me to London to blow it up? ... Gerry Adams. Yeah, fully sanctioned,’ she said. Price and Marian joined the IRA in the . 1970s. Her sister once claimed her miniskirt got her past British Army . officials in a car full of explosives. They had a Republican family . tradition. ‘My father used to sit us on his knee and tell us stories about how he'd . gone off to war in 1939 at the age of 19 to bomb the English,’ said Price. 'He said: \"If anyone doesn't want to go they should up and leave now . through the back door at 10 minute intervals\". The ones that were left . were the ones that went.' It is not yet known for sure how Price died, but . police in Dublin have confirmed they are investigating. Mr Adams, who strongly denies all the allegations, insisted he had no fears of what recorded interviews with Price might reveal as he expressed regret at her death yesterday. Asked about the prospect of the Boston College tapes now emerging into the public domain, he said: ‘I have no concerns over any of those issues because they are not true, but this is not the time to be rehearsing any of those. ‘We’ve just had news of this woman’s death and my thoughts are with her family, and her sister.’ Price married actor Mr Rea - who was one of the voices dubbed over that of Mr Adams during the 1980s broadcasting ban on him in Britain - in 1983. The couple, who have two sons together, divorced in 2003.

{"id": 15208, "article": "(CNN) -- A few days before the 1968 California Democratic primary, Washington Post reporter Richard Harwood told his editor he wanted to stop covering Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for president. Robert Kennedy's campaign for president lasted 82 days before he died on June 6, 1968. \"I'm falling in love with the guy,\" he said, according to Thurston Clarke's \"The Last Campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and 82 Days That Inspired America\" (Henry Holt). It was easy to see why. During his ill-fated run for the presidency, Kennedy appeared to be that rarest of candidates, the truth teller. By many accounts, he meant every word he said, particularly those about fighting prejudice and poverty. He refused to kowtow to his audiences, and he wore his emotions on his sleeves (adoring crowds sometimes shredded his cuffs). And he pondered questions before offering thoughtful, sometimes stammering, answers. Indeed, if Clarke's careful and moving book has a problem, it's that the author also seems to have fallen a little in love with his subject. The hard-nosed -- the preferred adjective was \"ruthless\" -- RFK who shrewdly managed his brother's presidential campaign gets short shrift. The book sometimes seems to exist in its own bubble, lacking the uncertainty that afflicted Kennedy in fighting his uphill nomination battle. But if you can get past the occasional hagiography, what emerges is a fine addition to the Kennedy canon.   Watch photographer, writer recall RFK's last days » . Clarke's book is illuminated by his interviews with Kennedy beat writers and audience members, which give his retracing of the campaign's exhaustive travels a striking immediacy. Given that there's no shortage of material on the man himself -- Arthur Schlesinger's mammoth 1978 \"Robert Kennedy and His Times\" and Evan Thomas' 2000 biography \"Robert Kennedy: His Life\" come to mind -- that's a worthy achievement. Clarke usually works on a grass-roots level, providing welcome glimpses of Kennedy's sense of humor and showing how even small RFK gestures stayed with people for decades. What they often remember is the challenge of the man, a candidate unafraid of campaigning among the poorest of the poor in cities and on reservations. While Hubert Humphrey preached the \"Politics of Joy\" in that brutal year -- and Eugene McCarthy simply lectured -- Kennedy answered questions with questions, at his best when he asked as much from his audience as he did from himself. Indeed, Kennedy seemed to revel in hostile audiences, Clarke observes. Some he won over with his candor. Others he couldn't have cared less about accommodating. At a speech at the Indiana University Medical School, he faced a stony crowd of doctors-to-be. \"All these programs sound very find and nice and all that, but where's the money gonna come from?\" one student asked about Kennedy's proposals to help the poor. Having listened to several similar questions, Kennedy had had enough. \"From you!\" he roared, pointing at people around the hall. \"From you! ... You!\" Probably only Mr. Smith, \"The Candidate's\" Bill McKay and Jay Bulworth could have gotten away with that. In Clarke's telling, the end comes quietly, two pages after the June 5 shooting. There's no investigation of conspiracy theories, no long recollections by friends. It's appropriate to his tone.  Watch Clarke talk about why RFK resonates » . There is, however, a fascinating postscript. Clarke found RFK's post-California schedule in the Kennedy Library, and the document shows what might have been, at least for 10 days: campaigning in his home state New York primary, bicycling in Central Park, attending a firemen's association event. Whether it would have led to the presidency is a cruel question history never answered. And with Robert Kennedy, questions are all that's left. \"Some men see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not,\" he often said, quoting George Bernard Shaw. Edward Kennedy read those words at his funeral.", "reference": "Reviewer: \"The Last Campaign\" worthy addition to Robert Kennedy books .\nThurston Clarke's work follows RFK through his 82-day presidential run .\nBook sometimes glorifies Kennedy, but with apparent reason ."}
{"id": 15209, "article": "By . Louise Boyle . The husband of the housekeeper who worked for Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade filed a court complaint that his wife was being kept in 'slavery-like conditions' and his family was threatened with being kidnapped, it has been revealed. Philip Richard, husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. The release of the new document this week reveals that a legal complaint was lodged against Devyani Khobragade in her home country prior to charges of visa fraud being filed against her in the U.S. this month. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed later in July because the Indian court had 'no jurisdiction... on foreign soil'. Consular official Dr Khobragade was arrested this month as she dropped her children off at their Manhattan school. She is accused of lying on a visa application for Mrs Richard with prosecutors claiming she only paid the servant $3 per hour. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York . In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions or keeping a person in bondage.' The petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of what the woman took. Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil'. The case has escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury over the treatment of Khobragade who claims she was strip searched at a New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers. Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month. Then, when the housekeeper came to the U.S., Khobragade told her that she would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according to prosecutors. India's foreign minister has demanded the U.S. drop charges against Khobragade. Although Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call to Indian officials last week to placate the situation, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara released a . statement saying that . the charges would not be dropped. Devyani Khobragade was arrested earlier this month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment . The statement read: 'One wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse?' Attorney Dana Sussman, who is . representing Mrs Richard though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe . Horizon, spoke on Sunday of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that . focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal . defendant. She pointed out that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard. Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage. In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court in December . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama during the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute . Ms Sussman refused to comment on her client and her family’s whereabouts since Mrs Richard walked out of her job in June. Dana Sussman, who is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row . Mrs .

False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian . authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s . parliament. Against this . backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial . here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that . there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those . charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker. ‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’ A group supporting domestic workers' rights demonstrate across the street from the Indian Consulate General on December 20 in New York .", "reference": "Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard, said that his wife was forced to work 17 hours a day .\nThe diplomat's father Uttam Khobragade allegedly threatened the housekeeper's family with abduction and being framed with drug charges .\nMr Richard's claim dismissed in .\nJuly, according to his lawyer, because the Indian high court has 'no .\njurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil'"}

{"id": 15211, "article": "Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, wants compensation from Facebook for alleged breaches in privacy . An Austrian court will consider a class action against Facebook by 25,000 people who are claiming their privacy has been breached. The David v Goliath case is being spearheaded by law student Max Schrems, who wants Mark Zuckerberg’s social media site to compensate him and his supporters with a symbolic £400 each. A hearing in Vienna on April 9 will consider whether the lawsuit is admissible. Mr Schrems began his legal challenge last June, claiming that Facebook supplied personal information to the US Prism spy programme. Over the next few months 25,000 people added their names to the lawsuit. The programme is the U.S. secret service's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden last year. Mr Schrems said that the court in the Austrian capital would have the power to make a judgment in the absence of a counter-statement from the social network. Mr Schrems is claiming damages of £397 (€500) per supporter, meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won, Facebook would have to pay out a total of £23.8m. As it stands, the company could still have to pay more than £9.9m if they lose the case. The action is being taken against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. The class action claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data and it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites, including the use of 'like' buttons. Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users and is worth around £118bn on the stock market. Founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously denied any link between Prism and his company. Facebook told MailOnline it had no comment to make on the case. On Monday Facebook and Instagram were down worldwide for around an hour after an alleged cyber attack. The online group Lizard Squad have claimed responsibility for the hack, which took the two social media sites down at around 6am GMT. Both sites, which have a total of 1.5billion users, appeared with error messages in the United States, Europe and Asia for around an hour. But despite hackers claiming they took the social media giants offline, Zuckerberg's Facebook, which also owns Instagram, refused to say what the fault was. There were claims online that the super-snowstorm that is over America's east coast may have knocked out its servers. The allegations centre around three main concerns including: . Facebook's Graph Search - this feature lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities. External website tracking - Facebook monitors Likes on other sites through embedded buttons. Big data analysis - the social network analyses interactions to learn about member behaviours. Graph Search was launched in July 2013 and appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page. It lets users find people who like cycling in London, for example, or which 18-year-olds in San Francisco are interested in horror films. When a user searches for something, that search not only determines the set of results they get, but also serves as a title for the page. Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile. The lawsuit is being taken in Vienna Regional Court against the Irish subsidiary of Facebook .

{"id": 15213, "article": "Scotland midfielder Shaun Maloney feels their dominant performance against Georgia was further evidence of how much more comfortable they are in possession under Gordon Strachan. Scotland needed an own goal to claim a 1-0 win in their opening home European Championship qualifier but the scoreline did not reflect their superiority, particularly in the first half when they forced a number of corners and pressed the visitors back. Although Georgia improved after the break, Scotland created far more opportunities and would have been more comfortable had they been more clinical in the final third. Steven Naismith missed two good chances and James Morrison forced a good late save. Shaun Maloney scores the winning goal in Scotland's 1-0 defeat of Georgia at Ibrox . Wigan midfielder has credited coach Gordon Strachan for introducing possession play to Scotland . Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall did not have a save to make, although Georgia sub Irakli Dzaria missed the target from 18 yards when presented with a decent chance in the final 15 minutes. For Maloney, the display showed Scotland are a team which is continuing to grow in confidence, with a further test to come on Tuesday when they take on a Poland side fresh from victory over world champions Germany. Maloney, whose 27th-minute drive eventually went in off Akaki Khubutia, said: 'It's something that we are not really known for, a nation that has a higher pass retention and more possession than the other team, but we are slowly trying to change that. 'We are trying to change that throughout the age groups but the most important thing at the moment is the first team and the manager has been speaking about it for the last 12 months or so. 'On Saturday night it probably came to fruition but I think it will be a completely different game in Poland, I don't think we will have as much of the ball as that, but it was certainly enjoyable. 'In the last 10 minutes we could have probably kept the ball a bit better and maybe not attacked every time we got it, and seen the game out a little bit more comfortably. But maybe I'm nit-picking. I think overall we have got to be pretty impressed with the first 70 minutes.' Maloney is congratulated by a Scotland fan after scoring his goal in the Euro 2016 qualifier . Everton striker Steven Naismith was guilty of missing opportunities against Georgia . Scotland's most recent qualifying campaign, for the Brazil World Cup, was undermined by a slow start when home draws with Serbia and Macedonia put pressure on them and led to calls for manager Craig Levein to be sacked. Levein survived for two more games but they were defeats in Wales and Belgium which left Strachan with an insurmountable task when he took over. Given that painful experience, Maloney was well aware how important winning the Ibrox encounter was. Scotland players celebrate after the result that takes them third in their group ahead of Germany . Scotland moved above Germany on goal difference after the world champions were beaten by Poland . 'It was a huge game for us to win,' he said. 'We have spoken about how well we have done in the last 18 months but now these games really matter, getting a home win was so important. 'We saw it out in the last 10 minutes. We should have got at least a couple more so the last 10 minutes we re a little bit uncomfortable. 'But it takes a little bit of pressure off us. The home games come with pressure from the fans and the expectations of trying to win your home games will transfer to Poland. I think we'll be tactically different and a little bit of pressure might come off us.' Scotland have already won in Warsaw this year - Scott Brown netting the only goal in a March friendly. Scotland are likely to change their tactics for their next game against Robert Lewandowski's (L) Poland . And previous away wins in Croatia, Norway and Macedonia under Strachan can give Scotland confidence for Tuesday night's game, no matter how buoyant the hosts will be following their 2-0 victory over Germany. Maloney said: 'Recently we have been pretty good away from home. The pace of (Ikechi) Anya has been huge and obviously Alan Hutton and (Andrew) Robertson, full-backs that pushed up on Saturday. 'It's a huge advantage if you've got pace in your side and at the minute we've got that.'", "reference": "Scotland defeated Georgia 1-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday .\nShaun Maloney scored the winning goal for the dominant Scots .\nWigan star has praised Gordon Strachan for introducing possession play ."}
{"id": 15214, "article": "The Chancellor is expected to announce the Treasury's funding of the investigation into six major banks . George Osborne will today offer a blank cheque to fraud investigators seeking to bring bankers accused of rigging currency markets to justice. The Chancellor will write to the Serious Fraud Office urging it to pursue a ‘blockbuster case’ against traders who clubbed together to fix foreign exchange (forex) rates. Six banks were this week fined after it emerged City workers were making what they called ‘free money’ by fixing currency rates in the 60 seconds before the close of trading and then making huge cash transfers. Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, UBS and Bank of America were handed a total of £2.6billion in fines from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for the latest scam. Regulators discovered that some of the manipulation of the £3trillion-a-day forex market was taking place even as the banks were being probed over a previous scandal over interbank lending rate Libor. The SFO is in the early stages of a major forex investigation. Funding for such probes – so-called ‘blockbuster cases’ – is provided with agreement with the Treasury. It provided more than £10million to pursue criminal wrongdoing in the Libor scandal – and is expected to make a similar sum available for the latest probe. Mr Osborne is expected to say: ‘We must continue to pursue criminal wrong-doing at the highest level; I have always made sure that the SFO has the funds it requires for its investigations. ‘I understand that the SFO is in the early stages of a major investigation into Forex trading. Given the importance of this work, the Treasury will provide the required funding for this investigation.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the public was ‘seething’ at the latest scandal. ‘I hope [the SFO] will bring people to book,’ he told LBC Radio. ‘People are seething with anger that they’re having to endure cuts and savings for year after year after year because of not only irresponsible, in some cases possibly criminal, behaviour by bankers.’ Punishment: Five of the world's biggest banks, including HSBC, have been fined a total of £2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market . Mr Clegg said it had not yet been decided what the Government would do with the £1.1billion of fines levied by the UK regulator. Fines over the Libor rate scandal have been used to support military charities and other good causes. In the latest scam, investigators found traders formed groups to help them manipulate currency exchange rates that would profit the banks at the expense of clients. Transcripts of conversations show how the traders referred to ‘free money’ and not wanting other ‘numpties’ in the market to know what they were doing. As well as inflating profits for their banks, traders are suspected of using the scam to boost their bonuses. Martin Mallett was fired this week for 'serious misconduct' The Bank of England last night faced calls from MPs to reveal why it sacked a senior official criticised for his role in the forex rigging scandal. Mystery surrounds the dismissal of chief currency dealer Martin Mallett, fired this week for ‘serious misconduct’ after 28 years at the central bank, just 24 hours before six of the world’s biggest banks were fined £2.6billion over the scam. The Bank said Mr Mallett’s dismissal ‘was not at all related’ to the scandal, but to a breach of the Bank’s ‘internal policies’. Last night two MPs on the Treasury Committee called on the Bank to explain precisely why he had been sacked. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘The Bank clearly has a duty to give that information – preferably publicly.’ Tory MP Mark Garnier added: ‘We need to find out what happened.’ The committee can exercise Parliamentary privilege to ask for confidential information. An independent investigation led by Lord Grabiner QC found no evidence any Bank official was aware of the actions of the traders. But it also found Mr Mallett was ‘uncomfortable’ with traders’ practices but ‘did not escalate the matter’.

So we have distilled the urine now and added natural ingredients like pine oil to cover the smell,' said Anuradha Modi from the Holy Cow Foundation. Ms Modi said she was working on a deal to get the company that supplies housekeeping items to government offices to use the product - which is called 'Gaunyle', with gau the Hindi word for cow. 'We have tested the product in labs and we can say that it is much better than the phenyl that you get in the market which is so full of chemicals,' she told AFP. 'We want to create a market for cow urine and I can say supply won't be a problem.' Method: The urine is distilled and spiked with natural perfumes to remove the pungent odour . Speaking to the Economic Times, she added: 'The product has been certified 'excellent' by labs in its pest-removing abilities.' While the sacred status of cows precludes India's huge Hindu majority from eating beef, their waste falls into the same acceptable category as dairy products. The cow, also known as 'Kamdhenu' - 'that which fulfils human needs' - is described in Hindu scriptures as the 'mother' of civilisation. Their revered status took on extra significance after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party won a landslide election victory in May last year. The party's election manifesto pledged to work to protect cows. On Friday the head of the company that supplies housekeeping products to government offices praised the urine cleaner. 'It is a great product for the health of safai karamcharis (cleaners) as well as for the cows,' Jagdish Bhatia said. Speaking to the Economic Times, he added: 'In 2004, the government employed experts from leading research institutes to find out more about the disinfectant qualities of cow waste but the study was terminated even before the team could reach conclusive results . 'However, from the preliminary studies, we understood that cow urine can be a good alternative to phenyl if mixed with the right components of other herbal extracts and scientifically treated.' Meanwhile, a growing cult of Hindu worshippers in India claim that drinking fresh cow urine will help cure them of all diseases - including cancer. The believers regard the cow as a holy animal and say her urine has divine healing properties. In the north Indian city of Agra, a growing cult of Hindu worshippers in India claim that drinking fresh cow urine will help cure them of all diseases - including cancer . Many say the recent increase in the number of people drinking cow urine can be attributed to campaigns run by spiritual leaders. Followers claim that cow's urine can successfully be used to combat cancer, diabetes, tumours, tuberculosis, stomach problems and much more. They also claim that drinking cow pee is the only effective solution for treating baldness.", "reference": "A charity is developing cleaning products made from cow's urine .\nThey hope the products will be adopted by government cleaning agencies .\nCows are considered sacred in India by the Hindu population .\nHindus are prohibited from eating cows but are allowed to consume waste .\nDrinking warm cow's urine is on the rise amid claims it can treat baldness ."}

{"id": 15219, "article": "MBOLA, Tanzania (CNN)  -- Moved by a 2007 trip to Ghana, singer/songwriter John Legend joined the fight to end extreme poverty in his lifetime. And based on his experiences in poor, rural areas of Africa, he says, real change is possible. John Legend says \"Mama\" Mwadawa Ruziga's role in uplifting her community inspired him. \"I don't want people to only see Africa as a bunch of victims,\" Legend says. \"The people that I've come across in these extremely impoverished villages, they want to work. They want to participate in their own development.\" To help people lift themselves out of poverty, Legend founded the Show Me Campaign, named after one of his songs. Partnering with economist Jeffrey Sachs' Millennium Promise organization, Legend's group adopted Mbola, a remote village in Tanzania that has little access to drinking water and improved farming techniques, according to Millennium Promise. \"The folks in Mbola are starting at a supreme disadvantage. Most of them are living on less than a dollar a day,\" Legend says. \"It's difficult for them to even survive.\" On his 2007 visit to Mbola, Legend met \"Mama\" Mwadawa Ruziga, a single mother of two who was freeing herself from poverty. Her entrepreneurial spirit impressed Legend and solidified his belief that sustainable development at the community level can work in the fight against poverty. Ruziga leads a local business collective that sells products -- like wine, jam and juice -- that it makes out of indigenous fruits. \"I was really inspired by her willingness to not just wait for a handout, but really take an active role in helping to uplift her community,\" he says. Through the Show Me Campaign, Legend has pledged to raise $1.5 million over five years to support programs similar to Ruziga's that are aimed at alleviating poverty in Mbola. But this is not just about cutting a check, he says. \"You can always go in and bring an influx of money and address things temporarily. But if development's not sustainable, then something's wrong,\" Legend says. \"This is about teaching them how to farm better, improving the education system, getting water pumps. The idea is that [the community] will continue to sustain themselves over time.\" Before joining her collective, Ruziga, 47, says her life was at an all-time low. For years, she suffered through malaria and droughts. \"The only thing I did was farming, then I would just sit idle with nothing to do. But after joining the group, my life changed for the better, slowly by slowly,\" Ruziga says. In addition to agricultural processing, Ruziga's group focuses on horticulture and tree planting. Ruziga herself has been instrumental to the success of the group, traveling to trade shows in the Tanzanian cities of Tabora and Dar es Salaam to sell their products. \"Our group has spread to other areas of Tanzania, and we've experienced great success because many people have come to know about us,\" Ruziga says.  Watch Legend talk about meeting Ruziga, and see her group making products » . Six different villages have adopted the group's successful model. \"I think she's a great example of someone who's given the tools to succeed, having the energy, having the follow-through, having the leadership skills to go ahead and do it,\" Legend says. Not only has Ruziga's group changed her own life, but other members' lives have also improved. This is the first time that some of them have ever earned an income. \"Now they are more educated than before,\" Ruziga says. \"The group provides them with a platform to exchange and explore ideas, and the revenue collected enables the members to cater for their basic needs.\" Ruziga believes that the future depends on women taking an active role in their future and says her community is happy with the help and encouragement Legend offers them.

What makes the Montlake Spite House in Seattle such a peculiar property is its unusual shape which is best described as V-shaped like a piece of pie . It is also one of the famous examples of a ‘spite house’ - a property built specifically to irritate neighbors or other parties by blocking out light or access to neighboring buildings. The property at Montlake fits the bill perfectly as a strange and impractical structure that occupies a small piece of land in front of another, larger property. Legend has it that the strange structure came about as a result of a bitter divorce between a married couple who owned the property directly behind it. Allegedly a judge awarded the husband the house and the wife the front yard; so out of spite she built the tiny home on top of her front yard to block out light and access to her husband’s property. The house is one of the famous examples of a 'spite house' - a property built specifically to irritate neighbors or other parties by blocking out light or access to neighboring buildings . Despite its unusual shape, the house is quite roomy inside 'with the exception of where it narrows into the kitchen,' says the owner . Current owner Lisa Horton firmly believes the legend that the property was built as a spite house but says that she’s heard that it was for an altogether different reason. ‘I can't imagine why else someone would build a house like that if it wasn't out of spite,’ she told Komo.com. She believes the dispute was over land. The owner of the land went back to Germany and allowed somebody to build a house on the property. The landowner requested that the builder leave him enough space to build his own home upon his return. But when the landowner returned, he saw that the new structure was much bigger than he’d expected and he could no longer build the home he wanted. 'Out of spite, he [the landowner] built that funny little pie-shaped home [as a barrier],' Horton told Quirksee.

'I also heard that back when it was first built, the side that was facing the neighbor had been painted black.'

Answers over seven years, a new study has uncovered the drug-related problems on the minds of six different nations. The revealing survey found that marijuana is by far the most talked about drug beating cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine, in every country but the UK. Scroll down for video . Marijuana is by far the most talked about drug  beating substances such as cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine in most countries. In the UK, cocaine is the most popular drug with around 32 per cent of all search queries relating to the substance . But it's not the effects that people are concerned with the most. A closer look at the data suggests that almost every nation wants to find out how to dodge a drugs test. The survey was conducted by drug-related website Detox.net, who focused on six countries; the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, and Italy. As well as the number of queries, the group looked at the first two words most commonly associated with questions about the drugs analysed. Overall, marijuana was the drug most people had on their minds, followed by cocaine, Xanaz, heroin, MDMA and opiates . In the US and Australia, marijuana appears to be the most popular drug, with the most common search terms being, 'how long do the effects last?' The most common questions for heroin is 'what is it?' follow by 'how long do the effects last?' and 'why do heroine?'. More people are concerned about how long the effects of marijuana last, than its health impacts . When it came to MDMA, 'Is it' were the two most commonly used first words when posing questions. In many cases, these words were related to the safety of using the drug, like: 'Is it safe to take MDMA while on antibiotics?' The most common question about bath salts, was where they could be purchased . When it came to Xanax, 'Is it' was the most popular pair of words leading off people's questions. Many of those questions were in regards to the safety of mixing the drug with other substances . Tweets often reveal growing trends among young people - and now scientists have revealed cannabis has become a popular topic. During a single month, researchers identified more than seven million tweets referring to marijuana, with 'pro-pot' messages outnumbering those opposed to the drug by 15 to one. Most of those sending and receiving 'pot tweets' were under the age of 25, and many in their teens, said the team. US psychiatrist and lead author Dr Patricia Cavazos-Rehg, from the Washington University Institute for Public Health, said: 'It's a concern because frequent marijuana use can affect brain structures and interfere with cognitive function, emotional development and academic performance. 'The younger people are when they begin using marijuana, the more likely they are to become dependent.' 'A lot of young people will phase out of marijuana use as they get older, but unfortunately, we're not good at predicting who those individuals are.' In the UK, cocaine is the most popular drug with around 34 per cent of all search queries relating to the substance. It is thought one in 20 British teenagers between 15 and 16 have tried cocaine. In May, tests revealed that cocaine use is so widespread that experts were able to locate traces of the drug in Britain's drinking water. Marijuana follows in second at 29 per cent and heroin in third, with 15 per cent of questions relating to the drug. The most common questions for heroin include 'what is it?' followed by 'how long do the effects last?' 'In this digital age, it's not surprising that people are seeking advice online,' Detox.net writes. 'However, what is startling is the extent to which people of all ages may forego real medical opinions on important health topics and, instead, settle for the virtual wisdom offered by faceless strangers.' To get a picture of what advice people were receiving, the group researched some of the answers to these questions. When people asked how long marijuana stays in their system, the most popular answer was that marijuana attaches itself to fat or is fat soluble, so typically it can stay in your system for seven days. Overall, marijuana was the most the drug most people had on their minds, followed by cocaine, Xanaz, heroin, MDMA and opiates . The survey used queries made on Yahoo! Answers over seven year. This graph shows how query numbers changed from 2007-2014, with marijuana searches spiking in 2011 . 'Since you only took one hit, the levels may not be high enough to detect in a UA [urinalysis],' the advice continued. 'Drink lots of water and exercise. You need to sweat a ton and burn some fat.' This, however, is only half-true, according to Detox.net. Marijuana takes longer than any other common drug to be cleared from your system because THC is stored in your fat cells. The rest, the site says, depends entirely on habits. The survey found that the most common question for bath salts was: 'Where can I get the bath salts that get you high?' Here, Yahoo Answers advised the anonymous to smoke weed instead. Detox.net said: While we don't endorse the illicit use of marijuana, it is without a doubt less harmful than substances like mephedrone, which is commonly present in cocktails labeled as 'bath salts'. The most common words to asked questions about marijuana included smoking, medical, high and help. The dangers of marijuana include inhibited brain development in teenagers and young adult, the website said . The most common words to asked questions about cocaine included smoking, help, test and songs. Overall cocaine was the second most popular drugs, with 15 per cent of search terms relating to the substance . 'The dangers of marijuana include inhibited brain development in teenagers and young adults, as well as respiratory problems from long-term use. 'Contrast those concerns with the immediate side effects of paranoia, agitation, hallucinations, psychotic behaviour, and violent behaviour that you get with bath salts.' The website says that though Yahoo! Answers might seem, at first glance, like a playground for pranksters looking to share awful advice with potential drug users, the best answers tended to be legitimately helpful. They often encourage drug users to seek help with their addictions or encouraging people to stay away from potentially harmful substances. 'However, if you or a loved one are seeking answers for drug-related questions or need help with treating an addiction, we would strongly advise turning to a professional for help before seeking help from an Internet community,' it added. Common words used to search for MDMA included ecstasy, pills, effects, cocaine, weed, bad, and Molly .", "reference": "This is based on questions asked on Yahoo!

Watch sons tell of their last year with their father » . \"He also was able to enjoy a lot of accolades, not just from obviously his natural constituencies in the Democratic Party, but ... quite moving testaments from many of his Republican colleagues,\" Teddy Kennedy Jr. said. \"It was really wonderful to see my father actually be able to revel in a lot of those compliments that people had to say about my dad.\" \"The really beautiful part about having that extra year with him where he didn't have to traipse all around the world and all around the country was that he was able to spend time with us, and we were able to be there for him emotionally and physically,\" Patrick Kennedy said. Despite their many family tragedies, they debunked the so-called \"Kennedy curse.\" \"You don't buy the idea of a curse?\" King asked. \"No. No. Obviously my dad had a sense of spirituality that transcended his ability to face these problems, you know, in a way that would have otherwise paralyzed the normal person,\" Patrick Kennedy said. Ted Kennedy Jr. added,  \"The Kennedy family has had to endure these things in a very open way. But our family is just like ... every other family in America in many ways.\" He also described the moment of his father's passing. \"I was there, Larry. It was very peaceful. ... He was suffering in those last few weeks [so] it really did take the sting out of his final passing. ... And it was a very peaceful, extremely spiritual thing.\" The sons elaborated on how their mother, Joan, has handled being divorced, her ex-husband's death and their thoughts on their stepmother. \"My dad was and remains a central figure in her life. Obviously, they both shared so much of their lives together,\" Patrick Kennedy said. \"The fact is that my dad and Vicki [Sen. Edward Kennedy's second wife] were so gracious. In all of the holidays, my mom was included. There wasn't any of this bitterness and everything. ... And I really am so grateful to Vicki for that, to my dad for that. \"Vicki was such a great sense of support to my dad at the end. \"My mom has been such an inspiration to me,\" Patrick Kennedy went on. \"She has struggled, as we talked about in an earlier program, with this disease called alcoholism, which I suffer from as well. She's been so public in her fight on this that she's inspired so many people and inspired me.\" The sons also talked about their father's memoirs, including the now-infamous episode at Chappaquiddick. After a July 18, 1969, party for those who had worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, Ted Kennedy drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. Although he managed to escape, his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. Kennedy did not report the incident immediately and later pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. \"Years ago, he spoke to me about exactly what happened that night,\" Ted Kennedy Jr. told King.\"And I knew how sorry my father has been each and every day of his life for what happened that night. If he could undo that moment, he would give anything to have been able to do so. \"And in this book ... he doesn't make an excuse -- any excuses. He accepts responsibility for what happened. But ... it's what you do with these tragic events that happen in your life that's really the measure of the person.\" They said they drew a lot of inspiration from reading \"True Compass.\" \"I feel like this book ... is a gift. It's a gift to me and my children who of course knew him as a grandfather but never really knew him as a man in the fullest sense of the word,\" Ted Kennedy Jr. said. \"I was a little worried when I first opened up the pages because even though he'd been talking about it and even though I'd heard many of these stories before, I really didn't know what to expect. And what I found was ... a riveting, riveting two-day read.\" \"Many people castigated him and attacked him and made him a caricature where he actually was a very real person as we've seen in this book,\" Patrick Kennedy told King. \"There wasn't a better politician around.

The millions of viewers who have already download the movie will have been treated to scenes showing James Franco cavorting with topless dancers and two girls kissing - scenes which are unlikely to impress North Korea's infamously uptight leader. Kim Jong-Un  has made no secret of its fury over the movie, and the FBI has continued to insist that North Korea is behind a cyber-attack on Sony, in which thousands of damaging documents were leaked. Scroll down for video . The millions of viewers who have already download the movie will have been treated to scenes showing James Franco cavorting with topless dancers . An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse suggested that the hack may have been an inside job carried out by disgruntled ex-Sony employees - but the FBI has dismissed the theory, claiming there is not enough evidence to stand it up. According to Politico, an official claimed the evidence put forward by Norse was 'narrow' and not an accurate analysis of the information. Last week, it was revealed that Sony removed a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un and television presenter Dave Skylark. But it seems that the racy scenes depicting lesbian kisses and half-naked North Korean women dancing did indeed make the cut. Certain scenes, including one showing two girls kissing, are unlikely to impress North Korea's regime . The movie, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' the feared dictator, has been a continuous source of tension between the U.S. and North Korea. Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate'. It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. Then a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace  launched a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents. Television presenter Dave Skylark played by James Franco (right) and Kim Jong-Un played by Randall Park (left) in a trailer for The Interview . But the attention brought to the movie over the hack and its initial cancellation by Sony, drove traffic to independent movie theaters and online when the company changed their mind and decided to release it on Christmas Eve. On opening day, the movie grossed $1million. Among the documents leaked in the hack was a version of the film's script including scenes which did not appear in the film released online and in movie theaters. Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'. The Interview grossed $1million on its opening day, when it was released online and in a few movie theaters . Kim Jong-Un (right) has made no secret of his fury over the movie, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' the feared dictator . A South Korean activist will launch balloons carrying DVDs of Sony's 'The Interview' towards North Korea to try to break down a personality cult built around dictator Kim Jong-un. Activist Park Sang-hak said he will start dropping 100,000 DVDs and USBs with the movie by balloon in North Korea as early as late January. Mr Park, a North Korean defector, said he is partnering with the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation, which is financing the making of the DVDs and USB memory sticks of the movie with Korean subtitles. Mr Park said foundation officials plan to visit South Korea around Jan. 20 to hand over the DVDs and USBs, and that he and the officials will then try to float the first batch of the balloons if weather conditions allow. 'North Korea's absolute leadership will crumble if the idolization of leader Kim breaks down,' Mr Park said. Details edited from the film include North Korean military insignia, which was originally visible on soldiers' uniforms in the film, and a conversation between Rogen and Franco about Kim Jong-un's sexual abilities. Over the weekend, the North Korean regime spewed racial slurs at President Obama as they blamed him for the movie's release. President Obama encouraged Sony to release the film in defense of free speech. 'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' a spokesman for North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement. President Obama has promised retaliation for the hack against Sony, but it's still unclear what punishment will entail.

President Obama greets Henrietta Hughes during a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Florida, on February 10. Henrietta Hughes caught the nation's attention in February when she cried for help during one of Obama's town hall meetings. After her plea, Hughes was given a free home to live in temporarily, but she is still struggling to find a job and might soon lose that home, CNN affiliate WINK reported Thursday. Hughes, who is in her 60s, faithfully goes to an employment center in Fort Myers in hopes of finding a job. \"It's almost our second home,\" Hughes told WINK. She and her son have taken a computer class at the center to help land work. Hughes said she has applied for as many jobs as possible but has struck out. Her son has had no luck either. Now Hughes says she feels time is running out. The home she lives in was donated by the wife of a Florida lawmaker, Chene Thompson, who has been trying to sell the vacant home in the Fort Myers suburb of Lavelle since 2006. Once the house sells, Hughes will have to leave. But Thompson told CNN that she will do everything in her power to make sure Hughes is not back out on the streets even if her house sells. \"I've told Miss Hughes ... she will never again be homeless, even if I have to personally assist her with her rent,\" said Thompson, who is a longtime advocate of the homeless. Thompson said Hughes reminds her of her grandmother and that she and her son are \"upstanding, good-hearted people.\" \"Her concern is that she doesn't want to be a freeloader,\" Thompson said, but Hughes and her son have helped deter vandals who have targeted vacant homes in the area. \"They really are a blessing for me,\" Thompson said. But Hughes told WINK that she worries that she could end up living in her truck again if she has to move without a job. Her plea to Obama came as he promoted his economic stimulus plan at a town hall meeting in southwest Florida. After talking about the plan, the president opened the floor to questions from the crowd. \"I have an urgent need -- unemployment and homelessness, a very small vehicle for my family and I to live in,\" Hughes said at the time. \"The housing authority has two years' waiting lists, and we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to. We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help.\" Hughes said her son had lost his job, leaving them homeless.

{"id": 15230, "article": "A lawyer representing the father of Australia's top-rated tennis player Bernard Tomic says John Tomic was acting in self-defense when he headbutted his son's training partner Thomas Drouet on Saturday. On Monday, John Tomic, who is also his 20-year-old son's coach, denied a charge of assault in a Madrid court which ruled that a judge will decide his guilt or innocence at a hearing on May 14. The incident -- which resulted in a broken nose for the Monegasque Drouet -- took place on Saturday afternoon outside the hotel in the Spanish capital where players were staying for the Madrid Masters. Bernard was in town to contest the tournament only to suffer a first round at the hands of Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic. \"I don't feel guilty. I did not do anything wrong,\" Tomic Senior told reporters of the fight. His lawyer Carmen Dieguez said the reason that Tomic Snr used his head, rather than his arms, to attack Drouet was because the tennis player, 29, was holding the coach's arms at the time. In a statement, Tennis Australia said they were awaiting further details before discussing the incident. \"Obviously media reports regarding a recent incident are very concerning,\" the country's governing tennis body said. \"We are working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident and are unable to comment further until the full facts are known.\" The incident continues the mixed career of Bernard Tomic, ranked 53rd in the world, and who was dropped from his Davis Cup side earlier in the year for what Australia captain Pat Rafter called a lack of professionalism. The youngster, who broke into the limelight when reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon as an 18-year-old, is no stranger to controversy involving his father, with the duo having been involved in several incidents. Croatian-born John, who moved with his family to Australia when Bernard was three, has been coaching his son since he was 13, even though a man who used to drive taxis for a living had no previous tennis experience. In 2009, John was forced to publicly apologize after telling his son to walk off court in the middle of a match against fellow Australian Marinko Matosevic in Perth as he was unhappy with the officiating. Despite the incident resulting in a one-month ban from the International Tennis Federation, John was up to old his tricks a year later -- railing at Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley so vehemently about the scheduling of one of his son's matches that security was ultimately placed around the official. Last year, Tomic Junior was booed off court at Wimbledon, picking up a code violation after smashing his racket, as he made a first round exit before then requesting that his father should be ejected from the stands at the Miami Masters later in the year. \"I know he's my father but he's annoying me,\" Bernard, who was ranked as high as world no. 27 last year, stated to the match referee. Tomic Senior has often clashed with Tennis Australia, having previously threatened to switch his son's allegiance to Croatia unless his demands are met. Matters seemed to be improving as Bernard won his maiden ATP title in January but this latest incident appears to be yet another setback in a stop-start career for a player with a fine record at junior level.", "reference": "Lawyer representing John Tomic says tennis player's father attacked Drouet in self-defense .\nDrouet of Monaco is the training partner of Bernard Tomic, Australia's top male tennis player .\nTomic's burgeoning career has already been blighted by several off-court incidents ."}

Egypt says it will recall its ambassador from Israel in protest over the deaths of Egyptian troops reportedly killed by Israeli soldiers. Israel has pledged to investigate the incident and this afternoon its defence minister Ehud Barak said it deeply regretted the deaths. Today crowds have gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo in protest. The deaths occurred on Thursday when militants from Gaza crossed . into southern Israel through the Egyptian desert and launched a deadly . attack that killed eight Israelis. Wounded Israeli soldiers are treated at the site of a shooting attack along the border between Israel and Egypt on Thursday . At least three Egyptian troops were . killed in a subsequent shootout in the Red Sea resort of Eilat between Israeli soldiers pursuing the . militants along the Israeli-Egypt border. Officials in Egypt have demanded an apology saying the country was 'politically and legally responsible' for the deaths. The decision to recall envoy Yasser Reda has escalated tensions between the two neighbouring countries. Their landmark 1979 peace treaty is being tested by the fall of Egypt's longtime autocratic leader, Hosni Mubarak. Egypt's interim government accused . Israel of violating that treaty with its raid that killed the Egyptian . troops in the Sinai Peninsula. Israeli emergency personnel stand near a bus after it was ambushed about 30 km north of the Red Sea resort of Eilat on Thursday . Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Israeli government was holding consultations on the Egyptian move. While relations between the two countries have been chilly since Egypt became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel in 1979, Israel valued Mubarak as a source of stability with shared interests in containing Iran and its radical Islamic proxies in the region - including Hamas. Several political parties issued statements condemning the Israeli raid and calling for changes to the peace treaty, which regulates the number of Egyptian troops allowed in the Sinai Peninsula. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is Egypt's best-organized political force, said 'this crime should be dealt with in an appropriate way,' adding that 'what was possible before the revolution, will not be tolerated to continue after the revolution.' Israeli officials insisted the peace treaty was 'stable' despite the rocky developments. The agreement called for Israel to return the captured Sinai to Egypt. In return, Egypt agreed to certain restrictions on the number of troops placed in Sinai. 'No one had any intention to harm Egyptian security personnel,' Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli Defence Ministry official who works closely with Egypt, told Israel Radio. 'The question is what happened in the field and that is what is being investigated.' The cross-border attack has raised concerns about the increasingly lawless northern Sinai Peninsula, whose borders with both Israel and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip make it an attractive staging ground for Palestinian militant attacks on Israel. Egypt last week moved thousands of troops into the Sinai Peninsula as part of a major operation against al-Qaeda inspired militants who have been increasingly active since Mubarak's ouster. A security official said 22 Islamic militants have been arrested. Israel says Gaza militants armed with guns, explosives, mortars and an anti-tank missile, killed eight Israelis in a roadside ambush after infiltrating Israel through Sinai. The Egyptian troops were killed as Israeli soldiers went after suspected militants who fled back into Egypt. Israel has offered conflicting accounts about how the Egyptians were killed. But the Egyptian Cabinet, in a strongly worded statement, held Israel 'politically and legally responsible for this incident,' saying lax security on its side allowed the ambush to take place. 'The Egyptian ambassador to Israel will be withdrawn until we are notified about the results of an investigation by the Israeli authorities,' the Cabinet statement said, demanding an immediate probe. It said Egypt would take all measures and send reinforcements to protect its borders and 'to respond to any Israeli military activity at the Egyptian borders.' It was the first time in nearly 11 years that Egypt decided to withdraw its ambassador from Israel. The last time was in November 2000 when the Egyptians protested what they called excessive use of violence during the second Palestinian uprising.", "reference": "Israel 'regrets' the deaths and promises an inquiry ."}

Lisa James, 29, from Llanelli, South Wales, started to pile on the pounds after the birth of her second child and at her heaviest she weighed 17st and struggled to fit into size 20 clothes. But less than two years later the mother-of-two is now a champion powerlifter, holding both the British and European records. Lisa started to gain weight when she was pregnant with her second child (right) but has now totally transformed her body by taking up power lifting (left) Lisa initially lost 4st in a year by drastically cutting her calories, but said she was very unhappy with her body . Auxiliary nurse Lisa started to count her calories and within a year her weight had plummeted to just 9st. She said: 'I lost the weight very quickly, about 4st just fell off. At my lightest I weighed 9st and was a size eight, but I just wasn’t happy. 'I’d lost my boobs and had a lot of loose skin as I lost the weight so quickly. I felt really self-conscious and it put a strain on my relationship, I couldn’t bear him touching me. 'I was also really tired and was feeling quite low. Then my partner - the dad of my kids - went off and had an affair, which made everything much worse.' In a bid to get back some of her self-confidence Lisa decided to have a boob job and increased her cup size to 34DD. But it was only when she took a job at her local gym that she decided to start improving her body by working out. Lisa says while she was unhappy being large (right), neither was she confident when she weighed 9st, and it is only since starting powerlifting (pictured with trophies, left) that she likes her body . Now the part-time personal trainer is a healthy size 10-12 and is more confident than she’s ever been. Lisa said: 'Initially I did all the usual stuff at the gym. But I was getting bored of doing the same sort of thing all the time and took up powerlifting. 'I’d see all the girls going to classes, but I wanted to try something totally different and have something to train for. 'Powerlifting really pushed me to my limits and I was instantly obsessed with it. I love training hard and seeing the results. Although she doesn't weigh herself Lisa is a healthy size and says she has never felt more confident . 'One year after I started losing weight I entered and won the 2013 Wales’ Strongest Woman competition. And then went on to win the World Championship Powerlifting in Chicago. 'I must have known I was overweight but now I find it hard to believe that I didn’t do anything about it sooner. 'But being skinny didn’t make me happy - I’m heavier now but I’m fit and healthy. It was the powerlifting that really made the difference. 'I cut out all bad foods and allowed myself one cheat a week and as the weight came off it gave me more motivation to keep going, my diet now is a bit different as I have to eat every three hours to keep my metabolism fast and I have to eat a high protein diet along with complex carbs and good fats. 'Powerlifting really pushed me to my limits and I was instantly obsessed with it. I love training hard and seeing the results' Lisa says . 'I don't have dairy and I don't eat any processed food or have any salt or sugar, I have a diet to follow pre-competition and I use Avenches biotech supplements to assist with my training - I'm sponsored by them and have the best advice and products off them to help me.' 'It’s changed me as a whole person. I’m more independent and I’m motivated.' The young mother is adamant that powerlifting is not just for men and actively encourages other women to take up strength sports. She said: 'I keep everything girly. All my kit is pink. That’s the message I want to give to girls: You don’t have to be manly if you’re a powerlifter, it’s about being strong and fit.' Lisa’s healthy outlook is something she hopes to pass onto her two children Kacey, six, and four-year-old Jacob. She said: 'My whole experience has made me want to motivate other people. 'I now run seminars to inspire other women to change their life, which is exactly what I did. 'I look better and feel better than ever before.

{"id": 15233, "article": "By . Sarah Griffiths . The origins of Little Red Riding Hood have been traced back 2,000 years by scientist. A Victorian image is pictured . The origins of Little Red Riding Hood have been traced back 2,000 years by scientists. And they believe finding the roots of other folk tales could show how humans migrated throughout history. Using techniques pioneered by evolutionary biologists, the new study reveals the folk tale first appeared in a spoken version called The Wolf and the Kids, which is still told in some countries. Today the two stories are distinct, although their shared root has evolved into a number of different stories told in Africa and Asia since the original yarn first appeared in Europe in the first century AD. Experts at Durham University used mathematical modelling to plot the 'evolutionary tree' of The Wolf and the Kids - a tale about a wolf that impersonates a nanny goat and eats her young. They found the British favourite Little Red Riding Hood, whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception, branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree. It evolved as a spoken story in France, Austria and northern Italy before being written down by French author Charles Perrault in the 1600s and was later re-told in its most familiar form by the Brothers Grimm, 200 years ago. While The Wolf and the Kids - which is popular in Europe and the Middle East -  was evolving from spoken word to the printed tale of Little Red Riding Hood in Europe, it travelled south to Africa and eastwards to Asia to become The Tiger Grandmother in Japan, China and Korea. Because the tale spent much of its early existence as a spoken story, it was difficult to trace back through time, as there are no written versions that could give researchers a reference point of date and place. Experts at Durham University used mathematical modelling to plot the 'evolutionary tree' of The Wolf and the Kids and found the British favourite Little Red Riding Hood, whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception, branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree . Durham anthropologist Dr Jamshid Tehrani, used a technique called phylogenetics - a mathematical modelling system - to compare 72 areas of similarity between 58 variations of the folk tale collected from around the world. The method is used by biologists for grouping closely-related organisms to map their evolution, but it helped him build a 'tree' that revealed the most likely branches, or paths, that the various versions took through time and revealed a surprising coincidence. Dr Tehrani explained: 'This is rather like a biologist showing that humans and other apes share a common ancestor but have evolved into distinct species. An illustration based on the fable The Wolf and the Kids, which highlights the dangers of talking to strangers . 'My research cracks a long-standing mystery. The African tales turn out to be descended from The Wolf and the Kids but over time, they have evolved to become like Little Red Riding Hood, which is also likely to be descended from The Wolf and the Kids. 'This exemplifies a process biologists call convergent evolution, in which species independently evolve similar adaptations. 'The fact that Little Red Riding Hood ‘evolved twice’ from the same starting point suggests it holds a powerful appeal that attracts our imaginations.' His findings, published in the Public Library of Science journal PLOS ONE, also overturned the theory believed by some that a forerunner to Little Red Riding Hood originally came from the Far East. 'It is claimed the tale spread west, along the Silk Route, and gave rise to both The Wolf and the Kids and the modern version of Little Red Riding Hood, Dr Tehrani said. 'My analysis demonstrates that in fact the Chinese version is derived from European oral traditions, and not vice versa. 'Specifically, the Chinese blended together Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf and the Kids and local folktales to create a new, hybrid story. 'This implies that the Chinese version is not derived from literary versions of Little Red Riding Hood but from the older, oral version, with which it shares crucial similarities,' he said. Dr Tehrani added that applying the technique to other folk tales could reveal how humans migrated throughout history, by tracing the folk stories’ origin in time and geographically. The tale of The Wolf and The Kids morphed into a German fable by the Brothers Grimm and is about a mother goat who leaves her kids at home but warns them not to open the door to a wolf who might impersonate her high voice. She says they can also recognise her by her white feet, but the wolf covers himself in flour so he has white feet and mimics her voice, enters the house and eats all except the smallest of the kids. The mother finds the wolf and cuts him open with a pair of scissors and her young spring out unharmed. She fills the wolf's stomach with rocks before sewing him up and the wolf is so thirsty, he goes to drink in a stream and drowns, while the family of goats live happily ever after. The tale of The Grandmother Tiger features a similar warning about strangers. A mother leaves her two children at home in a quiet village while she goes out on a long journey to get food and tells the children not to let strangers inside while she is away over night. But in the village there lives a bad tiger with a penchant for eating children. The big cat dresses up as a grandmother and in the middle of the night, eats the younger child. Realising the grandmother is really the tiger, the older, wiser child runs outside to wait for the mother to return.", "reference": "The original yarn, upon which Little Red Riding Hood was based, first appeared in Europe in the first century AD .\nDurham anthropologist Dr Jamshid Tehrani .\nused a mathematical modelling system to compare 72 areas of similarity between 58 versions of the folk .\ntale .\nHe found Little Red Riding Hood 'evolved twice'\nfrom the same starting point, suggesting the story holds a powerful appeal ."}
{"id": 15234, "article": "Fifty Shades of Grey will be shown in French cinemas to children as young as 12, after the country's film board gave it the second lowest possible age rating. The film was recently named the most erotic mainstream movie in a decade, after featuring more sex on screen than the 100 raunchiest films released in 2014 put together. The president of France's Board of Film Classification defended the low rating, saying Fifty Shades a 'schmaltzy romance' and 'not a film that can shock a lot of people'. 'Schmaltzy': France's Board of Film Classification has given Fifty Shades of Grey a '12' rating . The country's motion picture rating system has four grades - U, 12, 16 and 18, meaning that Fifty Shades has been given the second lowest certificate. France is known to rate films with sexual content lower than many other countries, including the U.S. and the UK. Films rated 'U' in France  include American Beauty, where Kevin Spacey's character has an affair with his teenage daughter's best friend, and Eyes Wide Shut, which features a famous sex scene between Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise - both rated 18 in the UK. Jean-Francois Mary, president of France's Board of Film Classification, deemed that Fifty Shades of Grey 'isn't a film that can shock a lot of people.' Mr Mary considers the film, that contains scenes of nudity and sadomasochism between an entrepreneur and a virginal student, 'a romance, you could even say schmaltzy.' Kids allowed: Even though Fifty Shades of Grey centers around the relationship between a young female student and a BDSM-obsessed man, the president of France's Board of Film Classification said it is 'not a film that can shock a lot of people' Kids allowed: Children as young as 12 will be able to see the film, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, which features a dozen sex scenes, making up a fifth of its entire running time . The '12' rating follows accusations by several American and British reviewers that the film is too tame. In a barrage of reviews published on Tuesday night, most of those who sat down with the raunchy adaptation ahead of its 13 February release date lamented its 'run-of-the-mill' lovemaking. One critic pointed out that sex only makes up 15 minutes of the two-hour runtime. Another pointed out that there are no visible genitals, no orgasms - and not that much nudity. Fifty Shades, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as the BDSM-loving Christian Grey, features a dozen sex scenes. The 'raunchiest of the decade' accolade was awarded the film after website Mr Skin, which ranks films by amount of sex scenes, released data seen by the Sunday Times. However, the film's director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, has said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for. 'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said. Defence: Jamie Dornan, pictured arriving in  Berlin, Germany, today has said he would not call film 'erotic' 'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different. 'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' Mrs Taylor-Johnson added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: . 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' Mrs Taylor-Johnson's opinion has been backed up by the film's leading man, who said he does not consider Fifty Shades an erotic film. 'I just wouldn't use the word \"erotic\" - it brings up different ideas for me. I just think we tried to make a good picture, you know?,' he told the Sunday Times. Fifty Shades of Grey has been rated R in the U.S. for its 'graphic nudity' and 'unusual behavior', and is rated 18 in the UK. Last week it was reported that the film had been banned from being shown in cinemas in Malaysia, where it was deemed 'too sadistic.' The series of three Grey books written by James, 51, from London, has reportedly sold over 100 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 52 languages.", "reference": "Fifty Shades of Grey given the second lowest age rating in France .\nChildren as young as 12 will be able to see the film in cinemas .\nLast week it was named most erotic mainstream movie in a decade .\nPresident of France's Board of Film Classification called it 'schmaltzy'"}

PUBLISHED: . 08:19 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:04 EST, 31 January 2013 . An overgrown mass grave containing the bodies of dozens of stillborn babies has been found at a cemetery after being forgotten for 50 years. The huge burial site is believed to hold the remains of more than 40 babies who were stillborn in the 1950s. It was discovered covered with bracken and branches in an area of Ford Park Cemetery in Plymouth, Devon - which is now preserved as a nature reserve. Wendy Sophola has discovered a forgotten 'mass grave' thought to contain the bodies of dozens of babies in a Plymouth cemetery. Mrs Sophola, is pictured with her sister Mary's birth certificate, who died within hours of being born . Wendy Sophola discovered the burial site while searching for information about her sister Mary, who was born on January 1, 1955, and died just a few hours later. She obtained documents from the cemetery showing the bodies of 41 babies are contained in an overgrown plot of land at the north end of the site. Mrs Sophola, 55, said: 'It's so sad. There must be lots of parents still alive whose babies are in there. 'There might be a mother hearing this and thinking, 'I had a baby in that year, I never knew that happened'. 'I have asked questions like 'how are they presented? Are they side by side or what? Were they in little coffins, or were they just wrapped in muslin? 'The cemetery staff said they are not quite sure but there are some on top of each other. I just said \"Oh my God.\"  It's disturbing. There is no respect for the dead.' Mrs Sophola, of Plymouth, grew up knowing she had a sister called Mary, who had died shortly after birth . Until last month, she had had no other information, until her father revealed that Mary had been buried in Ford Park Cemetery. Staff at the cemetery looked at old records and pointed Mrs Sophola towards a corner of the 34-acre site where her sister was supposedly buried. But she found the whole plot was overgrown with brambles and branches and she was not able to access Mary's grave. The cemetery opened in 1848 and was run by the Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport Cemetery Company until 1999. One of three plots where Wendy Sophola's sister could be buried, in Ford Park Cemetery Plymouth . When the company went into liquidation the Ford Park Cemetery Trust was formed to manage the site. The stillborn babies were laid to rest between January and December 1954 after being born at two of the city's hospitals except one who was apparently born at home. Trust chairman John Boon said: 'There are a number of graves in that area that the previous company used to bury babies who were stillborn or suffered neonatal death. 'They dealt with it in a different way to how we would probably do it these days, there is a greater awareness now.' Mr Boon said the area Mrs Sophola was asking about has been maintained as a wildlife reserve, but said he would possibly allow her to cut the area back. He said: 'I don't think this is any different to what other cemeteries do in terms of attitudes towards the burial of babies. 'All cemeteries back in that day did the same sort of thing. It was just a question of attitudes towards things in that day. 'We now have a dedicated area for the burial of babies where parents can buy freehold graves.'", "reference": "Burial site is believed to hold the remains of more than 40 babies who were stillborn in the 1950s .\nDiscovered in area of Ford .\nPark Cemetery in Plymouth, Devon, by Wendy Sophola as she searched for grave of sister ."}
{"id": 15236, "article": "(CNN) -- Artists Isabel and Ruben Toledo share a romantic magnetism that binds together their personal and professional lives. They finish each other's sentences; they encourage each other's fantastical whims. It's the kind of chemistry that creative types covet. The Cuban-born Toledos met in high school in West New York, New Jersey, and married in 1975. Since then, they have achieved success in their respective worlds: Isabel, as a fashion designer who counts Michelle Obama among her clients; and Ruben, as a cartoonist whose drawings have appeared in The New Yorker. They live and work together in a loft that takes up several floors in Midtown, New York, and offers a view of the Empire State Building. Neither considers their ascent to fame conventional and, in many ways, they still regard themselves as outsiders in the fashion world. So, when Isabel was approached about writing a book of fashion advice for women, she seized it as an opportunity to tell the world that there is no straightforward path to success, especially as a designer. Naturally, Ruben provided the drawings for \"Roots of Style,\" which was published this year. And, of course, he was wearing a black jacket and pants designed by his wife when they visited Atlanta in May for a student auction at the Savannah College of Art and Design. They spoke with CNN about love, life and labor. Below is an edited transcript of the conversation. Instant chemistry . It was \"love at first sight\" (for Ruben at least) in high school. Isabel, however, took a few years to come around. They have since been together for more than 30 years in a union, equal parts romance and business, that's the marvel of the fashion world. Ruben: Isabel walked into my Spanish class, and it was love at first sight within three seconds. Four years later, Isabel finally realized how she felt about Ruben. Isabel: I missed him. I missed the energy. And I kind of pursued him. Ruben: By then I was in a band -- I was already in Manhattan, I was doing my thing. I really grew up, so I think that was attractive to Isabel. So then we started dating, and then I wanted to marry her. She said no. Isabel: I was playing hard to get. Just like after high school, Isabel decided to make the definitive move in her own time. Ruben: She said, you know, I'm ready to get married. And then that freaked me out totally. I was like a deer in the headlights; I was like, 'Oh my god really!' You know, for us men, it's an important moment. I had to think, 'Now I'm responsible for this woman for the rest of my life.' Isabel: I went away. Ruben: You went away again! Isabel had accepted an internship restoring costumes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she stayed for about four years. Despite the odds, Ruben and Isabel somehow found their way to the altar -- over and over again. Isabel: We got married three times. Ruben: I called City Hall to ask 'I want to get married,' and they said 'this is what you do, you come to Room 34 at Window B,' so I thought I was getting married but in fact it was just to get the license. So all our parents went and threw rice at us. Isabel: So we turned around and said, 'we're married!' (The officials) were like, 'What?' Ruben: And they threw the rice, and we ran off to Canada, but we couldn't tell (our parents) we were living in sin, so we had this lovely honeymoon. Then we came back and had a secret wedding at City Hall with my brother and your sister as our witnesses. And then we had the official church wedding. It was very low-key because Isabel's dad had just passed away. It was very sad. White wedding, it was raining. Isabel: It was sealed. Art as self-discovery . Isabel's passion for \"engineering clothes\" began with sewing classes as a child in Cuba. For Ruben, drawing is the way he thinks and expresses himself. Whatever the means, both consider themselves artists first and foremost. Isabel: I've been sewing since I was 8, and I started sewing because I didn't find anything that I loved. We had this condo in Cuba, and (my mother) wanted us to go to a baby sitter. My older sisters were like, 'No way!' And she said, 'No, no, no, it's not a baby sitter, it's sewing classes.' So we thought we were going to school. And I'm the only one that picked up on it. My elder sisters were not interested. So it was by accident. Ruben, on the other hand, knew exactly what he wanted to do with his life from the start. Ruben: I could draw before I could write or talk. Drawing is how I think. To understand something, I have to draw it. I'm like the original caveman. Ruben and Isabel agree that being an artist means to have complete freedom. Ruben: I'm lucky enough to only take on the projects that interest me, whether it's doing somebody's portrait or doing a mosaic or doing animation or doing ceramic or doing book covers for whatever it is. That's a good place to be. You don't have to lie. You really do what you believe in, you really do what you care about. It's a wonderful gift. Success in synthesis . Isabel Toledo the fashion designer became a household name in 2009, when Michelle Obama wore a lemongrass shift and matching overcoat to her husband's inauguration as 44th president of the United States. Ruben: (The dress) was a gift from the universe. That was like one of those marvelous things. To be woven into history, it's beyond you! Isabel had a creative block; when time was running out, she noticed a small swatch of lemongrass fabric in her studio, and everything clicked. Isabel: The emotion behind the dress was that piece of fabric. And immediately, I think it was overnight, I kept saying, what is it gonna be? What is it gonna be? And we laugh about it because I had a tantrum: 'But it's too late now, it's too late!' And he says, 'Just send it, just send it!' Ruben: Isabel doesn't sketch anything. My job was to sketch it with the swatch and send in an e-mail and suggest it. So I finally buckled her down and said, 'Tell me what you want to do.' So she described what she wanted, and I sketched it down, we sent the quick sketch with the e-mail. Isabel: That same Saturday! Ruben: And five minutes later, we got an e-mail saying, 'Make it happen, make it warm.' Isabel: I still sweat thinking about that day. Isabel wasn't always into fashion, though, and to an extent she still isn't. Isabel: I'm not supposed to say I'm not a fashion person, but I'm not. I just, I love design. Design is so different than fashion. That's why design lasts forever. It's like an engineer. I love to engineer a garment. To make this thing work, to make it stand, to make this sculpture work. I get all enthralled if I have to come up with: How do I sew this cloth? What am I saying with the fabric? It's nothing to do with, 'what does it look like?' The next generation . When Isabel was asked to write a book of fashion tips, she refused. \"I don't give tips,\" she said. \"I make what I make, and women take to it. And they trusted me.\" The couple does have a few choice words for today's young artists: . Save everything you make, because you'll never be in the frame of mind to create the same thing twice. Ruben: Mistakes and false starts, that all leads to where you are. It's important. And it makes you 'you.' Isabel: That's your identity at the end. It's OK not to have a plan. Ruben: We didn't have a plan either, just be sincere in what you love. You don't have to lead, or even follow. Isabel: Just do what you do. Privately, in your own world. Ruben: We don't have a business partner. We've never had regular backing. We're independent. Expose yourself to art so you know how to make it -- and if you don't know how, make things by trial and error. Ruben: You may have great ideas and great concepts, but if you can't make it materialize, you're back at square one, you know? You're also at the mercy of people telling you it can't be done. Believe in your ideas. Ruben: We know that some things Isabel makes are years ahead of its time, but it's our job to let it happen, and perfect it in fact, so that when the world catches up to that idea, we're the best at it. That's why I think we're still around after 30 years. Are you in a dynamic relationship like Isabel and Ruben? Do you know someone with a similar story?

{"id": 15237, "article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Chris Cornell has taken to Twitter like Tweety Bird took to making mischief. Chris Cornell's new solo album, \"Scream,\" was produced by Timbaland. He acknowledges it's an odd mix. Not to suggest he's using the popular social networking service to cause trouble. Hardly. The 44-year-old rock musician said he enjoys the open stream of chit-chat with his fans. \"It's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone's probably had forever,\" said Cornell. \"And I don't mind answering them. And I can actually have conversations with fans that are quick, but still more meaningful than the typical situations you're put into. I've really liked it.\" His more than 200,000 followers can revel in bite-size musings about life on the road (\"crowd was amazing last night\") or sweet tweets to his wife, Vicky (\"hi baby! i miss you!\").  Watch Cornell talk about his Twitter fascination » . The former front man of Soundgarden and Audioslave -- who is also known for singing the James Bond theme \"Casino Royale\" -- is the first to admit he's a fan of experimenting. His new solo album, \"Scream,\" has him meshing his rock vibe with dance-floor beats by the much sought-after producer Timbaland. The collaboration has left some people scratching their heads. Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor took a swipe by twittering: \"You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable? Heard Chris Cornell's record?\" Ouch. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart, but it took a substantial tumble the second week. But Cornell -- who said he's never met Reznor nor read or responded to his tweet -- was more than ready for criticism. \"You could kind of see it coming,\" he said. \"Some of it is a script that was written just by putting [me and Timbaland] together. And most of the negative responses fit that script perfectly: 'You can't put these two things together. We don't like it! We're not going to let you! So we're gonna say bad stuff.' \" For Cornell, working with Timbaland required him to \"rinse away everything that I knew about songwriting and recording.\" He said the biggest challenge was in having to relearn how to sing to a different rhythm, his raspy voice needing to match up with slick studio beats rather than sliding loosely around the live, loud accompaniment he's so used to. \"To me it seemed like an exciting thing to just go and do,\" he said. \"I think this is as good as any album I've ever made, and I listen to it probably more than any other record I've ever made.\" Cornell spoke to CNN about Timbaland, Twitter and throwing stuff out windows. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Some people have said that you've lost your musical identity in this album. Chris Cornell: I don't have one, really. I don't want to have one. If I had a musical identity that was definable then it would be time to get into painting or something else. Race car driving. CNN: So you would be happy to be experimental on your next album? Cornell: Absolutely. CNN: So what was it like working with Timbaland? Cornell: He didn't really have a particular direction in mind in terms of what he wanted me to do. He did what Timbaland does, and I did what I do. We just wrote songs, which is really the best thing that came out of it. ... It doesn't sound like anybody else's record. It doesn't sound like music I've ever heard. It defies genre, and yet it's very much a song-oriented album as well as an album-oriented album. ... The music never stops. I've performed it that way. It's almost like a movie soundtrack. CNN: How often do you Twitter? Cornell: It depends. When I'm out on the road, depending on the day, a couple times a day I'll spend a half-hour or an hour or so. I've found that doing vocal warm-ups and Twitter at the same time, cause I'm a multitasker. I can watch CNN -- because I do -- and then I can be online and do vocal warm-ups all at the same time. And only one of those things is way too boring. CNN: I read a couple of your tweets, and you said that you were having trouble sleeping. Is that an occupational hazard? Cornell: Probably, yeah. I think everybody has a hard time when you play ... [a] show and then you're finished at 1:30 in the morning. It takes me an hour and a half to be able to eat after that and then to be able to sleep after that. It's hard. CNN: What is the biggest misconception about being a rock musician? Cornell: My first answer would be that it's just all a big party. But then I've been in that situation or seen bands like that where it is all a big party. I think overall there's this idea that it isn't work, that it isn't something that you have to put pretty much 100 percent of your focus and your being into, that it's like winning the lottery in a sense. And I think if you're a musician that's had any kind of success there is a component to that. There's some aspect to timing and luck, there's talent obviously as well. But it's a lot of traveling. It's a lot of waiting, it's a lot of leaving one city going into another city only to see the venue you're going to play in when you arrive, playing for the audience and then leaving and going to the next city. CNN: Have you ever thrown a really big object through a window? Cornell: Yeah. I threw an amplifier, a small one, through a window only because me and a few friends of mine that were out on tour together just made the observation [that] our generation just doesn't do stuff like that. So we sort of did it as kind of a ritualistic, \"OK, let's participate in the real thing.\" There was a piece of duct tape on the amplifier that had my name on it. So I had to run down to the alley and take that tape off so that they wouldn't know who threw it off to the street.", "reference": "Chris Cornell's new album is \"Scream\"\nFormer Soundgarden, Audioslave front man working with producer Timbaland .\nRock star life takes work, Cornell says .\nSinger once threw amplifier out window to sample old-school rock star activity ."}

Gerard Pique, Xavi, Dani Alves, Suarez and Neymar were all left on the bench against an Almeria team yet to win at home. Almeria, whose first team is worth around 10 times less than that all-star bench, could not believe their good fortune. They defended comfortably and attacked with purpose throughout the first half. Thievy, who was particularly prominent, put his team ahead on 37 minutes and it was no more than the strugglers deserved. Lionel Messi was dispossessed on the edge of his own area and the reaction from Barcelona said much for their current form. The Argentine failed to respond, dropping his head and beginning his stroll back towards his own half. Those around him also seemed to stand still. Messi had only lost the ball because none of the six players ahead of him had been in a position where they could be passed to.

Trailing 1-0 at half-time Barça were 45 minutes from losing three league games on the bounce for the first time since 2003. Luis Enrique’s team selection had back-fired with disastrous consequences. It must have been an uncomfortable visitors’ dressing room as he faced his players having already sent Suarez and Neymar out to warm up. Both came on at the start of the second half. Barça had mustered just one first half chance of note with Ivan Rakitic from the left and Messi looping a header on to the bar. Suarez’s second-half introduction almost brought the equalizer on the hour when he hit the cross-bar with an acrobatic volley after a Rakitic corner had been flicked on. And the former Liverpool man then wriggled clear down the right before centering for Neymar to roll in the equaliser. He could have put Barca ahead from the same right wing channel but his cross shot went just the wrong side of Ruben’s post. The Uruguay star then teed-up Messi but the Argentine headed on to the bar for the second time in the game. As the clock ticked down it looked as if Suarez second half show might bring only a point but with six minutes left he crossed from the right and Alba stroked the ball past Ruben for the winner. arça had their three points but Enrique’s team selection had made hard work of it and he had Suarez's second half performance to thank for the turnaround.

An extremist friend of the man who hacked soldier Lee Rigby to death with a meat cleaver has been jailed for three years - after calling for holy war against Britain. Ibrahim Hassan, 28, and his co-accused Shah Hussain, 31, published hate-filled speeches online two days after Fusilier Rigby was killed by Michael Adebolajo on May 22 last year. British Muslim Hassan, also known as Abu Nusaybah, was arrested moments after filming an interview with BBC Newsnight claiming to be a friend of Adebolajo. An extremist friend of Michael Adebolajo, Ibrahim Hassan, pictured left, and his co-accused Shah Hussain, right, have both been jailed for three years for calling for holy war against Britain and America . Michael Adebolajo shows a bloodied hand and knives following the murder of soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May last year . On the show he claimed Adebolajo had been tortured in Kenya, and had been offered a job by MI5.Hussain was arrested days later as part of the same investigation. Both men have previous convictions for encouraging terrorism at a 2008 rally, and are heavily linked to Adebolajo through banned terror extremist group, al-Muhajiroun. Judge Nicholas Hilliard, the Common Sergeant of London, told them: 'This is the second time that each of you has been before a court for an offence contrary to the Terrorism Act. That increases the gravity of the offences and I am sure both of you knew that you were playing with fire. 'Only time will tell whether your beliefs have really changed.' Both men showed no reaction as they walked down to the cells. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: 'Police became aware that Hassan was providing a pre-recorded interview to BBC Newsnight on Friday, 24 May and they duly attended and arrested him. 'The . interview shows him endeavouring to mitigate for the actions of Michael . Adebolajo, the murderer of Lee Rigby, due to his having been tortured in . Kenya six months before and allegedly harassed by the secret services. 'However . Hassan also makes it plain that if he had known of the planned attack . he would have sought to dissuade Adebolajo from it, and that he was . horrified by it.' Drummer Lee Rigby, pictured, of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was attacked and killed by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Now extremist friends of Adebolajo have been jailed for calling for a holy war against Britain . The two men met in 2004 at meetings of the banned fundamentalist terror group founded by hate preachers Omar Bakri Muhammed and Anjem Choudary. In 2008, they were each jailed for two years after being filmed encouraging terrorism at a rally outside the Regents Park Mosque. In his speech, Hassan said: 'My dear Muslim brothers, I urge you right now, Sheikh Osama Bin Laden has already told us that these kafirs will never be pleased with us. 'We should be preparing, all of you should be training for jihad.' He threatened to kill Tony Blair and called him a 'coward'. 'By Allah, myself I'll go for Tony Blair when his cover is broken,' he said. 'Tony Blair is the enemy to me. By Allah if I get the opportunity I will assassinate, put him in a grave. 'Tony Blair's a pig, he's a kafir, he's a kafir. George Bush the same message to him. 'I'll cut your neck off.' Hussain said in his speech that he would 'slaughter' George Bush if he were to see him and had a knife. Both admitted disseminating a terrorist publication relating to an audio file of a speech by the deceased radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki which called for the execution of anyone who insulted the prophet Mohammed. Michael Adebolajo, left, was given a whole-life jail term after murdering Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year while  Michael Adebowale, right, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 45 years . Hassan also admitted encouraging terrorism related to video lectures entitled In Pursuit of Allah's Governance on the Earth. Hussain admitted encouraging terrorism in a video lecture entitled 'Signs of a Good Death in Islam'. One of the signs he mentioned was 'death on the battlefield' by fighting against British and American forces to earn martyrdom and a place in paradise. Others included death by plague, fire, pleurisy, drowning, abdominal illness and under a collapsed building. Hussain ran a website hosting his own lectures, links to videos features preachers including Abu Hamza, Abu Qatada, and Khalid al-Husainan, and a text called 'Reality of the Rulers' by Abu Zubair Adil al-Adab. He also hosted a video of a speech given by Khalid al-Husainan and a text called 'Reality of the Rulers' written by Abu Zubair Adil al-Adab. The court heard Hassan came to the UK from Somalia in 1995 with his sister and converted to Islam in around 2004. He has two children with one partner and two-step children with another. Pall bearers carry the coffin of Lee Rigby into Bury Parish Church for an overnight vigil following his brutal murder. Now extremist friends of one of his killers have been jailed for calling for holy war against Britain . Mozammel Hossain, representing Hassan, said Hassan had left Al-Muhajiroun in 2010 and had made the 'utterly stupid' lectures to please his audience of former colleagues. Hassan wrote a letter claiming he did not excuse or condone the Lee Rigby murder and was 'shocked' by Adebolajo's actions. Lawrence McNulty, for Hussain, said that his client had also left Al Muhajiroun before it was proscribed by the Government and had changed his views. Hussain, of Cannon Street Road, Whitechapel, east London, and Abdullah-Hassan, of Carr Road, Walthamstow, east London, both admitted disseminating terrorist material and encouraging or inciting terrorism on or before May 24 last year. Hussain was jailed for three years concurrent on each count while Hussain was jailed for three years for dissemination and 28 months concurrent for encouraging terrorism.

{"id": 15241, "article": "(CNN) -- French legend Julien Absalon took his status to new heights when he became the first rider to defend the men's mountain bike Olympic title. Sabine Spitz of Germany celebrates her victory in the women's mountain bike on Saturday. Absalon kept the gold in French hands for the third Olympics in a row -- following Miguel Martinez's victory at Sydney in 2000 -- thanks to a commanding display early in the 36km race which left his rivals trailing. \"The Olympic Games is a massive motivation for every athlete and four years passes quickly, as it has from Athens to Beijing,\" said Absalon, who finished well ahead of compatriot Jean-Christophe Peraud with Nino Schurter pipping world champion and Swiss compatriot Christoph Sauser to the bronze medal. A highly-fancied Swiss trio failed to match Absalon's early pace after he had begun to steadily grind out a lead by the second of the eight scheduled laps. \"It's great to do the double. It feels totally different (from 2004), but this just confirms what I achieved in Athens,\" added Absalon, who denied that he had made his victory look easy. \"I had as tough a race as everyone else. When I saw the chance to make the break I went for it. After that I really gave it everything I had.\" In the women's 27km mountain bike race, defending champion Gunn-Rita Dahle from Norway was one of several contenders to fall victim to a course that was finally mastered by Germany's Sabine Spitz. The 36-year-old, who only began racing at the relatively late age of 22, was determined to improve on her bronze medal in Athens. She started fast and was soon racing on her own to gold ahead of Poland's Maja Wloszczowska, who finished with the silver ahead of Russian Irina Kalentieva. \"I feel pure joy at what I have finally achieved after so many years of hard work,\" said Spitz. \"Winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games is the crowning glory.\" The first boxing medals were decided on Saturday with Felix Diaz of the Dominican Republic winning his country's first ever Olympic boxing title after beating Thailand's Manus Boonjumnong to take the light-welterweight gold. But Thailand made amends in the flyweight final when Somjit Jongjohor comfortably out-pointing Cuban Andris Laffita 8-2 to claim his first Olympic gold. Vasyl Lomachenko of Ukraine won the featherweight gold medal, capping a spectacular run through the tournament with a first-round stoppage of France's Khedafi Djelkhir. James Degale of Britain won the middleweight gold medal, upsetting Cuba's Emilio Correa in a sloppy bout, while Correa failed to emulate his father's gold medal performance for Cuba in 1972. Rakhim Chakhkiev of Russia gained revenge on Italy's world champion Clemente Russo by claiming heavyweight gold. Chakhkiev was beaten by Russo in the final of the world championships. China's Ma Lin won gold in the men's singles table tennis tournament, defeating teammate Wang Hao to secure a clean sweep of all gold medals on offer to the host nation. World number two Ma fought off world number one Wang in a scorching final strewn with fast and furious rallies to win 4-1 and cement China's status as the superpower of the sport. The victory hands China a clean sweep of all six medals in the singles competition, after teammate Wang Liqin removed the last obstacle to the Chinese Wall -- defeating Sweden's veteran Jorgen Persson for the bronze medal. A goal from Christopher Zeller in the 16th minute gave Germany the men's field hockey gold medal by defeating Spain 1-0 in the final. Australia took the bronze with a 6-2 win over the Netherlands in the play-off between the losing semifinalists. Australian Matthew Mitcham won the men's 10m platform diving title to spoil China's bid for a sweep of all eight diving gold medals. China's Zhou Luxin settled for silver, while Russia's Gleb Galperin claimed the bronze medal. Elsewhere, on the penultimate day of competition, Russia won the team event and swept both gold medals in synchronized swimming for the third consecutive Olympics. Russia finished with a combined 99.500 points after Saturday's free routine. Spain took the silver with 98.251 points and China claimed the bronze with 97.334. Anastasia Ermakova and Anastasia Davydova already won gold in the duet on Wednesday and were also part of Russia's eight-woman squad for the team event. Norway's women's handball team won their first Olympic gold medal, beating Russia 34-27 in the final. Norway rushed to an 8-1 lead after just eight minutes and remained well ahead for the rest of Saturday's match. Neither Norway nor Russia has ever won a gold medal in women's handball. Brazil won their first women's volleyball gold medal after defeating the United States 25-15 18-25 25-13 25-21 in a hard-fought final. Saturday also saw the remaining six disciplines decided in the canoeing, with Ken Wallace of Australia winning the gold medal in the men's 500-meter kayak singles. The first-time Olympian won in one minute, 37.252 seconds from Adam van Koeverden of Canada. Briton Tim Brabants took the bronze medal to add to the gold he won in the 1,000m race. Inna Osypenko-Radomska of Ukraine won gold in the women's 500-meter kayak singles, just nipping Italy in a tight finish. Osypenko-Radomska's time of 1:50.673 seconds was enough to just pip Josefa Idem of Italy, with Germany's Katrin Wagner-Augustin taking bronze. Saul Craviotto and Carlos Perez of Spain won gold medal in the men's 500-meter kayak doubles, slipping past the defending Olympic champions for victory. Craviotto and Perez clocked 1:28.736 seconds to edge Ronald Rauhe and Tim Wieskotter into silver in a major shock as the German pair have been world champions since 2001. Raman Piatrushenka and Vadzim Makhneu of Belarus took bronze. Katalin Kovacs and Natasa Janic of Hungary won the gold medal in the women's 500-meter kayak doubles, successfully defending their Olympic triumph in Athens.

Sergey Ulegin and Alexander Kostoglod of Russia won silver while the German pair of Christian Gille and Thomasz Wylenzek took bronze. Mexico's Maria del Rosario Espinoza won the gold medal in the women's 67kg taekwondo category. Espinoza, the 2007 world champion, easily defeated Norway's Nina Solheim on points after going ahead in the first round and never falling behind. Winning bronze were Britain's Sarah Stevenson, who defeated Egypt's Noha Abd Rabo, and Brazil's Natalia Falavigna, who outscored Sweden's Karolina Kedzierska. Russia's Evgeniya Kanaeva won gold in the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around competition, posting the highest score in all four rotations of the event. Her final total of 75.500 points was enough to beat Inna Zhukova of Belarus, who gained 71.925 points for the silver. Anna Bessonova of the Ukraine had 71.875 points for her second straight bronze. In women's basketball, Lisa Leslie of the United States capped off her illustrious Olympic career with a fourth straight gold medal, scoring 14 points in a 92-65 victory over Australia. She joined former teammate Teresa Edwards as the only basketball players ever to win four Olympic gold medals. \"It's a blessing for me to be out on this floor, now participating in my fourth Olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal,\" Leslie told the Associated Press.

{"id": 15242, "article": "(CNN) -- A 37-year-old white supremacist, Kevin William Harpham, was sentenced Tuesday to 32 years in prison for placing a bomb-laden backpack along the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane, Washington, in January, the U.S. Justice Department said. Harpham, an unemployed electrician from Colville, Washington, pleaded guilty in September to charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to commit a federal hate crime. Shrapnel in the \"improvised explosive device\" contained anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting, authorities said. After he is released from prison, Harpham will serve the rest of his life under court supervision, federal prosecutors said. \"Harpham admitted that he is a white supremacist and white separatist, and that he placed the explosive device at the march with the intent to cause bodily injury to the person or persons in order to further his racist beliefs,\" a Justice Department statement said. Federal prosecutors had recommended that Harpham be sentenced to 32 years in prison, according to court documents. He was sentenced in federal court in Spokane. The January 17 march was attended by about 2,000 people, including racial minorities, authorities said. \"Today, Mr. Harpham faces the consequences of his hate-filled act. A prototypical 'lone wolf' such as Mr. Harpham presents a particularly vexing threat -- with nothing foreshadowing a carefully planned attack,\" Laura M.

Said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, in a statement: \"Acts of hate like this one have no place in our country in the year 2011, but yet, unfortunately, we continue to see attempted violence in our communities due to racial animus.\" The backpack containing the device was discovered, and no one was injured. But law enforcement officials said that if Harpham had succeeded, many people could have been harmed. He had packed a 6-inch steel pipe with 100 grams of black powder and more than 100 fishing weights, which were intended to be shrapnel. In addition, Harpham coated the weights with an anticoagulant. According to court documents, he intended to set off his bomb using a transmitter and receiver from a remote car starter device. The plea agreement says Harpham's DNA was matched to the backpack; investigators tracked his purchase of the fishing weights to a local Walmart store and the purchase of the remote triggering mechanism to an Internet transaction; and they retrieved a camera from his home that contained pictures Harpham had taken of himself at the march.", "reference": "NEW: Kevin William Harpham is prototypical \"lone wolf,\" FBI says .\nNEW: The 32-year sentence is what prosecutors sought .\nHarpham is a white supremacist who says he meant harm, a document says .\nA backpack with a bomb, shrapnel and anticoagulant was traced to Harpham ."}

Experts have called for the HPV vaccine to be offered to gay men as a way of curbing cancer rates. The UK vaccination programme against the HPV infection began in 2008, but only among girls, on the grounds that this would curb the spread of the infection to boys as well. But doctors at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Homerton University Hospital, and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, said gay men are more than 15 times as likely to develop genital cancer as a result of becoming infected with HPV. The UK vaccination programme against HPV began in 2008, but only among girls, on the grounds that this would help to curb the spread of infection to boys too . While rates of anal cancers are higher among men who are also HIV positive - despite antiretroviral treatment - they are also higher among gay men who have not been infected with HIV, said the authors. Australian research has shown that HPV vaccination of girls has had an impact on the rates of genital warts in heterosexual men, but that there has been no such change in prevalence among gay men, according to a report by MedicalXpress. Recent research has shown that the HPV jab is effective in men, including gay men. The vaccine covers HPV 16 and 18, the two strains of the virus which cause most of the cancers associated with the infection. HPV causes genital warts and is associated with a higher risk of genital as well as head and neck cancers . The vaccine is most effective in those who are not already infected with these strains of HPV, but evidence has shown that only a minority of young gay men are, and that the strategy to vaccinate a group that includes those who have already been exposed to these strains is cost effective. Data from the UK's Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) has shown that fewer than one in 20 men under the age of 25 has been infected by any high risk HPV strain. In 2010, 17,000 gay men between the ages of 16 and 26 visited sexual health clinics in England. Experts said that HPV vaccination would help prioritise initiatives to improve access to services for this group, who remain vulnerable to HIV infection. 'In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of universal vaccination of boys, the argument for introducing targeted HPV vaccination for [men who have sex with men] up to age 26 years is strong,' they concluded. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is spread through sexual contact and is more usually associated with cervical cancer in women. It is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. HPV can be passed between men and women by genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. It may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. It can be passed on between straight and same-sex partners—even when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. The cervical cancer jab given to 12 and 13-year-old schoolgirls aims to cut their odds of the cancer by protecting them against the virus. Although most mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking and smoking an increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils and back of the tongue are due to HPV. Although the cancer is not contagious, the virus is. In the US, HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the tonsils and the back of the tongue, which experts say could be due to increasing popularity of oral sex. The typical patient is described as an otherwise healthy man in his late 40s or early 50s who has never smoked or smoked very little. In Britain, the number of mouth and throat cancers have increased by 40 per cent in just a decade, to 6,200 cases a year. Cancer Research UK says the HPV virus may be key to the ‘rapid rise’. Symptoms include persistent mouth ulcers, pain, discoloured patches and difficulty chewing and swallowing. Men are advised to check their neck for lumps when shaving and both sexes to look at the back of their throat while brushing their teeth. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are often more successful in mouth and throat cancers caused by the virus than those caused by tobacco and alcohol. Although mouth cancer can be caused by HPV passed on by oral sex, doctors say Michael Douglas’s claim that oral sex is also a cure doesn’t make any medical sense.", "reference": "Doctors at the the Royal Liverpool .\nUniversity Hospital said gay men are more than 15 times more likely to .\ndevelop genital cancer .\nHuman Papillomavirus infection causes genital warts and is associated with a higher risk of developing genital, head and neck cancers .\nUK vaccination programme against HPV .\nbegan in 2008, but only among girls, on grounds that this .\nwould curb spread to infection to boys too ."}

{"id": 15247, "article": "One in 10 London homeowners face spending hundreds of pounds every few years on property valuations because of Ed Miliband’s plan to introduce a ‘Mansion Tax’, it has been revealed. The Labour leader has vowed to impose a levy of up to £15,000-a-year on homes worth over £2million in order to shore up the NHS. More than 100,000 homeowners could be hit immediately by the tax, which is expected to be a levy of 1 per cent. But thousands more families - the vast majority in London - could be forced to pay for valuations of their homes by surveyors because of Britain’s volatile housing market which can see increases of over 20 per cent in a year. House prices are soaring by more than 10 per cent a year, which could drag more and more properties into the 'mansion tax' band . Mr Miliband says the tax will raise £1.3 billion, which will be used to hire thousands of NHS staff. But some 250,000, just under one in 10 of households in the capital, will be forced bring in surveyors to assess whether their property exceeds £2million, according to experts at Knight Frank estate agents. They will also face fines of thousands of pounds if the taxman disagrees with the valuation they submit. Labour has insisted it will not introduce a wholesale revaluation of properties to see how many multi-million pound properties are being bought and sold. Instead, the party is considering a similar scheme to the one developed by George Osborne to target super-rich individuals who buy large houses through businesses, avoiding stamp duty. Mr Osborne’s scheme means those who buy houses through companies have to report to the taxman what the house is worth, with those over £500,000 subject to a tax. A penalty of 30 per cent of the tax owed is imposed if the wrong amount is declared through ‘carelessness’, rising to 100 per cent if it was deliberate. Labour leader Ed Miliband said a mansion tax would raise almost £2 billion which would be used to hire tens of thousands of NHS staff . But critics have raised concerned that thousands risk could be forced to pay the tax unfairly because estate agents are inflating the asking prices of homes. Under Mr Osborne's scheme valuations must be undertaken every five years. A senior Labour source said shadow chancellor Ed Balls was looking at using a ‘similar model’ to Mr Osborne’s. Yesterday it emerged pensioners hit by the levy could see the money taken out of their estates when they die. Labour peer Lord Adonis has criticised his party's 'mansion tax' proposal . Elderly homeowners who do not have the income to pay up front could defer the tax until their death. It would mean that their families could be faced with bills running to tens of thousands of pounds. Only a tiny number of people are expected to be exempted from the tax which, it is feared, could hit the so-called ‘asset-rich, cash-poor’ homeowners who live in properties whose value has soared in recent years but do not have the ready money to pay the levy. Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, told the BBC that one solution would be to offer ‘relief’ to some long-term residents or allow them to ‘defer payments until the property was sold’. A string of prominent London-based Labour MPs have already come out against the levy – which they see as a ‘tax on the capital’. And Labour’s candidates for London Mayor have also opposed the measure, which would disproportionately affect London. Yesterday Lord Adonis criticised the proposal, saying: ‘People whose houses have been inflated into much higher values and suddenly find themselves therefore facing a much higher tax bill, many of whom will not be people of means, we need to play fair by them too.’ Labour say the £2 million threshold will rise each year in line with house price inflation, and the level will be banded so the most expensive properties are levied the most. One estate agent said the policy would suppress the value of homes close to the £2 million threshold. The policy has alarmed MPs in the capital. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said there was a \"big question\" around how houses would be valued. \"If [it is] on current value, then London pensioners living in same home for years will be hit hard,\" he said.", "reference": "Labour vowed to impose levy of £15,000-a-year on homes worth over £2m .\nMore than 100,000 homeowners could be hit immediately by the tax .\nBut around 250,000 property owners could be forced to pay for valuations .\nAs house market booms owners face £500 valuation bill every few years ."}
{"id": 15248, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Vernon Baker earned a Medal of Honor for his actions during World War II. But because of what the U.S. government acknowledges was racism against African-Americans who performed heroically in the war, it took more than 50 years for him to get what he had earned. Baker, one of only seven African-Americans to receive the nation's highest military honor from World War II, died Tuesday at his home in Idaho, according to his hometown police and coroner's offices. He passed away after a long battle with cancer. His wife and members of his family were by his side. He was 90 years old. Baker was orphaned at the age of 4, and was raised first by his grandparents and later at Father Flanagan's Boys Town in Nebraska. He joined the Army six months before the Pearl Harbor attack and was part of the 92nd Infantry Division, the first unit of \"colored\" soldiers to see combat in World War II. He eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant and was leading a platoon against entrenched German machine gun nests near Viareggio, Italy, on April 5, 1945. His official Medal of Honor citation describes what he did: . \"When his company was stopped by the concentration of fire from several machine gun emplacements, he crawled to one position and destroyed it, killing three Germans. Continuing forward, he attacked and enemy observation post and killed two occupants. With the aid of one of his men, Lieutenant Baker attacked two more machine gun nests, killing or wounding the four enemy soldiers occupying these positions. He then covered the evacuation of the wounded personnel of his company by occupying an exposed position and drawing the enemy's fire.\" After spending the better part of a day putting his life at risk to lead his unit, Baker was back in action the next evening: . \"On the following night Lieutenant Baker voluntarily led a battalion advance through enemy mine fields and heavy fire toward the division objective.\" Baker was originally awarded the Army's Distinguished Service Cross for his action. But in the early 1990s, a study was done to find why none of the more than 400 World War II Medal of Honor recipients was black. The study found \"a racial disparity in the way Medal of Honor recipients were selected.\" Seven African American heroes from World War II were chosen to receive the Medal of Honor from President Bill Clinton. Four of them had died in the war, and two others had died in the time since the war. Only Baker was at the White House to have the iconic star and pale blue ribbon draped around his neck. During an interview with CNN before the White House ceremony on January 13, 1997, Baker spoke about the racism that delayed recognition of him and his fellow Medal of Honor recipients: \"As I look back on it, it really makes me feel sad that we did our job, we fought, but we weren't appreciated\" After the White House ceremony, Baker told CNN, \"I still don't feel like a hero. I just feel I was a soldier and I did my job, and I think I was rewarded for it.\" Baker is survived by his wife, Heidy, and five children. He is expected to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.", "reference": "Baker, who received the Medal of Honor more than 50 years after his heroic acts, dies at 90 .\nHe took out several machine gun nests firing on his unit in Italy .\nThe U.S. government admitted racism was a factor in Medal of Honor decisions .\n\"I just feel I was a soldier and I did my job,\" Baker said after the 1997 ceremony ."}

{"id": 15250, "article": "(CNN) -- Firefighters on Friday battled a massive wildfire that has so far claimed more than 100 homes in northern Colorado. The High Park Fire has scorched more than 52,000 acres, forced thousands of people to flee and claimed at least one life. The blaze was 15% contained Friday, up from 10% on Wednesday. Nick Christensen, an executive officer with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, said Friday that 112 homes have been destroyed. Many burned days ago, but authorities are just starting to get into the affected areas to assess the damage, he said. That figure is expected to rise. \"It's really not just a list of numbers; these are stories. Each one of these represents a family that's been displaced from their home -- that may have lost some family heirlooms, some photos, possessions, kids' toys,\" Christensen said. \"It's really devastating and sad.\" At least one of the homes belonged to a Larimer County Sheriff's Office employee, he said. First measured at two acres early last Saturday, the High Park Fire -- which officials say was caused by lightning -- has since grown exponentially. It is about 15 miles west of Fort Collins, Colorado. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from across the United States to help local departments. Besides the main blaze, they are also battling a 200-acre spot fire, which broke out just north of the burn area. Helicopters flew back and forth Friday, dousing the flames with water. Complicating firefighters' efforts was a thunderstorm, which brought little rain, but kicked up strong winds, said Brett Haberstick, an incident command spokesman. \"The higher humidities definitely help. It reduces the opportunity for fire to spread. The wind, however, is not a good opportunity,\" he said. Incident meteorologist Dave Lipson forecast a similar thunderstorm Saturday.

{"id": 15251, "article": "(CNN) -- On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton delivered the first of a series of lectures on public service at his alma mater, Georgetown University. When questioned by a student on the failure of the legislation on gun background check in the Senate, Clinton spoke in parables. \"You know that old story about, the problem with a cat that sits on a hot stove is that cat will never sit on a hot stove again, but also it will never sit on a cold stove. I think this is a cold stove,\" Clinton mused. Like most parables, the message was clear. For the past 30 years, the NRA has bought many elections with massive spending and grass-roots campaigns. No candidate who has ever been scorched on the NRA's stove wants to get burned again, so they cower in the corner. Politicians quake in fear whenever CEO Wayne LaPierre threatens hellfire and brimstone upon any apostate with the temerity to question the NRA's gospel of the gun. But America is finally fed up. New surveys by Public Policy Polling and Quinnipiac University confirm Clinton's view that the public has cooled to the NRA. Several senators who voted against background checks have taken hits in their approval ratings. From February to April, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's overall approval rating dropped 8%. In Ohio, Sen. Rob Portman's rating went down 9% since October. And Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada saw his rating go down 3% since October/November. Alarmingly, for the NRA, this show of disapproval is happening in red states that should be gun rights strongholds. Being on the wrong side of history can be painful. Today's more tea-flavored GOP politicians find themselves badly positioned on guns. Their ideological rigidity on immigration reform, marriage equality, reproductive rights, Wall Street reform and numerous other hot-button issues is unpopular. When you factor in the outrage over gun violence, Republicans -- who seem inextricably bound to the NRA in the public's mind -- are under the gun. This week, in a town hall meeting, New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who voted down background checks, was confronted by the new political reality up close and personal. Erica Lafferty, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the principal at Sandy Hook and among the first to be gunned down, asked Ayotte, \"You had mentioned that day the burden on owners of gun stores that the expanded background checks would harm. I am just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't more important than that.\" Ayotte defended her vote. But questions like the one Lafferty asked won't go away. We will see how the gun issue plays out on the national stage in the coming months. If senators lose support because they refuse to give way to some gun control regulations, we may see some changes of heart. This has certainly been the case in the debate over immigration reform. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised to bring the matter to the floor again in light of the popular support for immigration reform. It's possible that we may even see a background check bill come back to the Senate later in the year. Of course, the gerrymandered House is quite another matter. So finally, the heat may be on the NRA for a change. And for the senators who voted against background checks, it looks like they've jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. As usual, Bill Clinton saw it coming. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joe McLean.", "reference": "Joe McLean: The NRA has bought many elections with massive spending .\nMcLean: But Americans are finally fed up and seem to be cooling toward the NRA .\nHe says some senators who voted down background checks saw a hit in approval ratings .\nMcLean: More politicians may change their minds if they lose support for opposing gun control ."}

Gary McKinnon is ready and willing to stand trial in Britain, his family said yesterday. After the dramatic decision by Home Secretary Theresa May to block the computer hacker’s extradition to the US, the spotlight falls on Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer. Mr Starmer must now decide whether Mr McKinnon can be charged in this country. Prosecutors are being encouraged by the US to bring the 46-year-old to justice in the UK. Ready: Computer hacker Gary Mckinnon, pictured, with his mother Janis Sharp, is willing to stand trial in Britain, his family has said . Some supporters claim he has suffered enough already, by having spent ten years on bail, living under the shadow of extradition. But his mother, Janis Sharp, said: ‘Our ten-year battle was to stop Gary being sent to stand trial in the United States. We have always said we wanted him to face justice in a British court. If he is charged, so be it. ‘After what Gary and my family have been through this is almost the least of our worries. We will deal with it. We are just delighted and overjoyed that Mrs May blocked his extradition.’ Asperger’s sufferer Mr McKinnon – who faced up to 60 years in a US prison for hacking into Nasa and Pentagon computers looking for evidence of the existence of alien life – was yesterday coming to terms with his reprieve alongside his family and girlfriend Lucy Clarke. Mrs May stopped Mr McKinnon’s extradition on human rights grounds after medical reports showed he was very likely to try to kill himself if extradited. In the spotlight: Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer must now decide whether Mr McKinnon can be charged in this country . The decision – a huge victory for the Mail’s Affront to British Justice campaign – was applauded by MPs and civil liberties groups. It is the first time a Home Secretary has blocked an extradition to the US under the hugely controversial Extradition Act 2003. Mrs Sharp said yesterday: ‘This was the first morning we could wake up without this awful fear hanging over my family. Gary says he had forgotten what it feels like to be happy. ‘He’s still tense and it will take time but we now want to concentrate on helping Gary get his life back on to an even keel.’ The DPP provoked fury when he ruled in 2009 that there was ‘insufficient evidence’ for Mr McKinnon to be tried in Britain, even though Mr McKinnon admitted hacking into the US computers from the bedroom of his North London flat. If a UK prosecution does proceed, it would probably be under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, with a maximum sentence of five years. The US expressed anger at Mrs May’s unilateral decision to halt extradition. It raised questions about whether the Americans – who hold the bulk of the evidence against Mr McKinnon – would co-operate in the legal process. However, officials say the diplomatic fall-out has been limited. The US Department of Justice stressed: ‘Our extradition relationship with the United Kingdom remains strong, as is demonstrated by the extradition of five alleged terrorists from the United Kingdom just last week.’ David Cameron’s spokesman said the Prime Minister had not been in touch with the US authorities to discuss the McKinnon case. Mr McKinnon’s lawyer Karen Todner said last night of Tuesday’s decision: ‘I believe the decision was a courageous one but it was also both legally and morally correct. ‘The medical evidence that I supplied to the Home Secretary was overwhelming and extremely powerful. It would have been astounding for her to ignore it. ‘I do not believe that this case sets any precedents. The medical evidence in Mr McKinnon’s case was, in my view, unique. ‘I hope that Mr McKinnon and his family will now be able to enjoy a modicum of normal life after enduring ten very difficult years.’ Decision: Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the computer hacker's extradition to the US .", "reference": "Computer hacker's extradition to the US was blocked by Theresa May .\nDirector of Public Prosecutions to decide whether he can be charged here ."}

Gina Yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in Wednesday's landslide. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governor's office and the White House, he said. Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. On Wednesday, a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld told San Diego's KGTV that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed.

{"id": 15256, "article": "Norman Mailer once likened Mohammad Ali to the Prince of Heaven. Some of the articles about Susie Wolff, the Williams test driver of all things, have been only moderately less gushing. She has been described by the Telegraph as the fastest woman in the world. The writer of that phrase may have taken her lead from a documentary of the same name about Wolff. That documentary was made by David Stoddart, who just happens to be Wolff's brother. I do not know Wolff at all. A friend of mine is a friend of hers and I am assured she is a nice woman. But it would be idle to deny that the hype has overtaken the reality in the projection of her as a future Formula One race driver. The evidence simply does not support the notion. To suggest otherwise is not only an insult to people's intelligence but to several drivers of greater promise. Dressed for success: Susie Wolff, the Williams development driver, poses for a fashion shoot . Behind the wheel: Wolff during testing for Williams at Silverstone, the home of the British Grand Prix . A few facts. She is not the fastest woman in the world. Danica Patrick is way ahead of her. Patrick's victory in the 2008 Indy Japan 300 is the only win by a woman in IndyCar series history and her third place at the Indianapolis 500 is he best finish by a woman. Wolff has never won a race in a car, as opposed to a kart. In DTM she has finished the season in 17th, 20th, 18th, 16th and 13th places and twice been not classified. She competed in Formula Renault and Formula Three for five years without any particular distinction. By contrast, James Calado, another Britain, finished second in the F3 Championship, second in GP3 and third in GP2, yet he is racing in sports cars after failing to cut the mustard in Formula One testing. Why then is Wolff Williams' test driver? Could it be anything to do with the fact her husband, Toto Wolff, became a director there in 2009? Surely not. (In passing, how can Mr Wolff be a shareholder at Williams and executive director at Mercedes?) Despite her lack of experience in an F1 car – one straight-line test and day in the young driver test at Silverstone last year – Wolff, 31, continues to make her case for a race seat and will, ludicrously, drive in practice sessions during grands prix weekends at Silverstone and Hockenheim this season. 'I focus on performance because once I put my helmet on it doesn't matter what I look like,' she said recently. 'If I don't perform I'm out. 'I'm not on a crusade to prove women deserve to be here. I'm on a crusade for Susie Wolff. I just want to be the best racing driver I can be. If I can break down barriers as well as help people, I will.' I wish her luck. I merely register my belief that the Susie Wolff story is primarily a publicity stunt. Missing out: Promising Brit James Calado has been overlooked by F1 teams . One or the other? Wolff poses with fashion accessories on her Twitter . Chequered flag: But it is debatable whether Wolff deserves her place . Those of us who believe in the rule of law – as opposed to anarchy – respect the FIA's role as the policemen of Formula One. So logic says we should hail the judges' decision to reject Red Bull's appeal against Daniel Ricciardo's expulsion from the Australian Grand Prix and instead support the FIA's right to determine what the rules are. But I am not sure it is as simple as that. Red Bull claim, quite convincingly I think, that the FIA's fuel sensor was unreliable and that they, in fact, were not breaking the fuel-flow limits. The FIA's authority surely depends on their enforcing the law fairly and correctly. Otherwise what legitimacy do they have? Unlucky: Red Bull had a case with Daniel Ricciardo's appeal . Seeing McLaren's de facto team principal Eric Boullier piling suitcases full of car parts nose high on several airport trollies this weekend reminded me of a nickname given to his predecessor, Martin Whitmarsh. Max Mosley, then the FIA president, disparaged Whitmarsh as 'the bag carrier', for supposedly lugging around Ron Dennis's briefcase. Speaking of Whitmarsh, I understand he is still in the process of agreeing his severance package. It is likely to be around £6million, a quarter of a million for each of the 24 years he was at McLaren. Factoring in that his final salary at McLaren was £2.5m, that's quite some compensation for Mosley's cutting remark. Pay-day: Former McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh is likely to receive a pay-off of around £6million . Seeing as the smog in Shanghai is in your face – not to mention possibly creeping into one's lungs – it would seem a somewhat futile exercise to blank out coverage of the problem. Yet type 'Shanghai' and 'smog' into Google over here and it is hit and miss whether the related stories are accessible. On Thursday, next to none would open up. Friday, they would. Is this some form of half-baked censorship? That suspicion would be abated if the 'official' figures measuring the micrograms per cubic metre were not markedly lower than those issued by the US Consulate. Whatever the criteria, there is a gas mask in my hotel room. Difficult to breathe: The smog in Shanghai has hardly been mentioned by officials . Mercedes are wary of having their image tarnished by association if Bernie Ecclestone's criminal trial, which starts in Germany next week, should find him guilty of bribery. They cite 'compliance', referring to a European law about probity in company affairs.

Mastermind: The new explosive is believed to be the work Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri known as Al-Qaeda's bomb-maker in chief . It would . be undetectable under current security measures and remove the need for . terrorists to mix liquid explosives on board, security sources told the . American TV network ABC News yesterday. The latest threat to air passengers is . one of the reasons behind the current global terror alert, according to . two senior US government officials. British bomb expert Sidney Alford . confirmed that the new method was possible using easily available . chemicals, but pulling it off would be tricky as the soaking process . would dilute the explosive. He said: ‘The clothes act as a diluent and reduce the power of the explosives.’ However, igniting treated clothes . could be done simply with a match. Passengers are allowed to carry a . single box of safety matches or a cigarette lighter on flights.

Christmas Day in 2009. Other reports have suggested that Al-Asiri is developing bombs that could be sewn under the skin of terrorists. The level of ‘terror chatter’ being . monitored by security services has been described as one of the most . serious threats to American and Western interests since the 9/11 . attacks. In response, the Foreign Office last . night evacuated all staff from the British embassy in Yemen. The U.S. State Department, based at the White House, Washington (pictured), has instructed its embassies and consulates in the Muslim word that would normally be open on Sunday to close this weekend amid reports of an unspecified threat .

The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said.

Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen. Known as Al-Qaeda's bomb-maker in chief, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is believed to be behind a range of explosive devices including pant bombs and liquid explosive implants which contain no metal parts making them virtually undetectable. Al-Asiri, 31, who is linked to the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) group, was reported to have recruited his own brother Abdullah al-Asiri as a suicide bomber in a failed 2009 attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Deputy Minister of the Interior. An early version of his pant bomb was used in the the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, when a Nigerian man attempted unsuccessfully to detonate the device aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. An updated version, which incorporated fail-safe triggers and used a new kind of explosive that was even harder to detect was supplied for a terrorist attack in May last year to mark the anniversary of Osama Bin Laden’s death. That plot was foiled when the suicide bomber turned out to be a double agent and handed the device to the FBI . He is also believed to have been behind an intercepted pair of explosives-laden printers that were mailed from Yemen to the U.S. in 2010. In September last year he was reported as having been possibly killed in a drone strike together with other AQAP suspects but a Yemeni government official later denied the claim. He is currently considered to be one of America's most wanted men. 'He’s the main guy,' said one counterterrorism official. 'He’s the top of any list.'

The excavated tools are similar to others found at sites occupied by early modern humans at a later stage, who replaced Neanderthals in Europe around 40,000 years ago. 'If Neanderthals developed this type of bone tool on their own, it is possible that modern humans then acquired this technology from Neanderthals,' said Dr Marie Soressi, one of the researchers from Leiden University in the Netherlands. 'Modern humans seem to have entered Europe with pointed bone tools only, and soon after started to make lissoirs.

Another possibility is that early modern humans started influencing Neanderthal behaviour earlier than has been thought, said the scientists writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Neanderthals were genetically different from early modern humans but may have been closely enough related to interbreed.

Yet more doubts have been raised over the authenticity of 'reality television' show Breaking Amish after one character revealed she has been divorced, which is rarely allowed in the Amish community. Cast member Rebecca accepts a proposal from Abe on the TLC show, which depicts the two meeting in New York for the 'first time' - yet they are believed to already have a child together in real life. It has now been claimed that, despite the 'revelation' on the show, Rebecca left her first husband, Rufus Hostetler, to start a relationship with Abe in 2010. The claims spark yet more trouble for Breaking Amish, which has repeatedly come under fire for deceiving viewers since its launch more than a month ago. TLC says the show follows five Amish and Mennonite men and women as they leave their communities for the first time and head to New York City - yet this story has slowly crumbled. Scroll down for video . 'Honesty': Breaking Amish cast member Rebecca, right, tells her fiance Abe, left, that she is divorced . Secret: But in reality, the couple are believed to have been together for two years and have a child . While each cast member claims to have . grown up in the strict communities, evidence has surfaced suggesting . they have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce, arrests, children . and domestic abuse. It . comes in stark contrast to the naive characters portrayed on the show, . who stare slack-jawed at Manhattan's towering buildings and pray as they . travel by plane 'for the first time'. Among the characters, Rebecca and . Abe are portrayed as meeting for the first time on the show - with a . possible love match on the cards. But, after the show depicts the pair . getting closer and Abe proposing to Rebecca, she reveals she has been . divorced - to his apparent shock. 'False claims': On the show, Rebecca and Abe, pictured, claim they have never met before . 'Falling in love': Rebecca had actually left her husband for Abe shortly after her marriage in March 2010 . 'I have to make a decision between you and, like, being Amish,' he says on the show. But a photograph uploaded to a Facebook page,  Breaking Amish the Truth, apparently shows that the pair in fact already have a child together. Reports and . marriage records reveal that Rebecca married Rufus Hostetler in March . 2010 before divorcing him this past summer, although their relationship . apparently broke down much earlier. In . a message on Hostetler's Facebook wall in October 2010, he writes: 'I . am tryn 2 figure out why in th world abe schmucker wud want to b a . friend on face book afterall he left wht my wife.' And . while Abe claims in the program that he has never partied, police . records - and a mug shot - reveal he was arrested for alcohol . intoxication in a public place in 2008, when he was just 18. Old life: Blog reports identified her ex-husband as Rufus Hostetler, pictured with his new girlfriend . In perhaps the most shocking revelation about the real lives of the characters, Jeremiah, another cast member, is divorced from a woman who claims he repeatedly beat her. Brush with the law: A mug shot of Abe from 2008 after he was arrested for being drunk in public . Public records reveal that 32-year-old Jeremiah Raber, who regularly swears on the show, has three children -  two daughters, aged seven and three, and a son, five. The children live with their mother, Naomi Stutzman, . in Ohio. The couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011, . citing gross neglect of duty, extreme cruelty and incompatibility. Speaking to CBS21, Stutzman, who has also left the Amish community, called the show 'a fake' and lambasted TLC for perpetuating lies on a family channel about a man accused of repeatedly attacking his wife. 'The kids and I suffered for years at the hands of this man,' she said. 'My family is livid because they took . him in and cared for him, now he is doing this? I'm not surprised at . him. What surprised me was TLC. My kids and I watch TLC. They are . supposed to be a family channel. For them to do this is appalling.' Police reports showed she called authorities on at least eight occasions and Jeremiah was arrested for domestic violence in 2005. She said that his violence eventually led to their break up. 'Reality' TV? TLC's show Breaking Amish has come under fire for its false claims about its characters' pasts . On one occasion, he punched her in . the stomach while she was pregnant, a police report notes. She said that . TLC offered her $10,00 to stay quiet on the incidents, which TLC . denies. She added that, . while Jeremiah is shown getting a large arm tattoo in Breaking Amish, . he has in fact had it for years - and it bears the names of his three . children. Jeremiah was also reportedly away from his Amish community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans. Daniel Gingerich, who claims he lived with Jeremiah for a year and a half, added: 'I've known him for years. I let him move in because he was living out of his truck and had no place else to go.' And the other cast members apparently were holding back some information, too. On the show: Jeremiah says he is desperate to break away from his Amish community on the show - but has reportedly already spent 14 years away . Past: Photographs from an old MySpace page show Jeremiah looking decidedly un-Amish . TLC has previously admitted that . Kate, who is billed as an Amish bishop's daughter and aspiring model, . has been arrested for a DUI, but now new information paints an even more . rebellious picture. As revealed on a Facebook page,, she . has previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds . with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent . 'vanity' which they deem a sin. Online records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her Amish life to move to the city. This internet savvy version of Kate is a far cry from an episode of Breaking Amish in which she is overwhelmed by new technology and struggles to work an elevator.

She is pictured on her wedding day in a ceremony that is not traditionally Mennonite. The apparent betrayal by the creators of Breaking Amish is documented on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger. Scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their 'real' lives. Mose Gingerich, a former Amish who appeared on a separate show, Amish in the City, lambasted the show for its dishonesty. Dark pasts: TLC had previously admitted that Kate, pictured left on the show, was arrested for DUI, right . Aspiring model: A photo of Kate has been found online from a smiling contest in 2010 . 'This . show is doing exactly opposite of what I stand for,' he wrote on his . blog. 'The fakeness of these characters supposedly just leaving the . community, when in fact, they have been out for many years. 'The . fact that they act like things like microwaves and iPhones are . something strange, when indeed, they have owned them for years . themselves, and the disrespect they show towards the Amish. 'I would never stoop to doing a show like this, and really wish no one else would have done it either.' In response to the outrage, TLC has said it will address the revelations in time.

The tar mat, a slab of oil residue mixed with wet sand, was about 165 feet long by 65 feet wide, said Lt. Cmdr. Natalie Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. It weighed more than 40,000 pounds, but more than 85% of that weight was sand, shells and water, she said. The mat was found under the surf off Isle Grand Terre, Louisiana, about 90 miles south of New Orleans. Crews using an excavator dug the largely submerged tar mat out of the beach in chunks over the last few weeks, Murphy said. Empty nets in Louisiana three years after the spill . Louisiana is the last state where regular cleanup operations from the oil spill are still under way.

An elderly man drowned his lodger's cat in an apparent revenge attack after it knocked over his model aeroplane. Neil Lewis, from Colchester, placed the animal in a pet box before submerging it in the River Colne until it stopped breathing. The 72-year-old - who owned another cat - later justified his actions by telling police the cat was a 'pain' and 'scratched things'. The cat was taken to a veterinary surgery after a witness called police, but it was already dead on arrival. Colchester Magistrates' Court heard how Lewis's lodger Alexander Hammond had brought the kitten home last November. He had found it at the town's railway station and was unable to trace its owner. But the court heard how Lewis -who has bipolar - began developing some 'hatred' for the cat, as it got older. At one point, Lewis suggested to Mr Hammond that they should take the cat into a nearby meadow and set it loose. But in April this year, he had had enough of the cat and decided to carry out the killing. Colette Harper, prosecuting, said: 'As it got older, he noticed the defendant had some hatred for the cat. 'He told him he was fed up it because it knocked his model airplane over.' She added: 'He was seen to place the pet carrier fully in the water.' The court was told how, when police arrived at the scene, Lewis told them: 'I didn't like that cat, it was always a pain and scratched things.' He added: 'There's another cat at home I like - that's my cat.' Laura Austin, mitigating, told magistrates that Lewis had a 'significant history of mental health problems'. She said: 'This was exacerbated by a serious traffic accident he was involved in a year ago. He knows in hindsight what he did was wrong. Lewis took the animal to the River Colne (pictured) in a pet carrier, before submerging the box under water . 'He saw a short-term solution to the perceived problems he was facing at that time, not thinking of the consequences. 'The defendant is a somewhat educated person who, without these mental health difficulties, would have behaved entirely differently.' Lewis admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. He was given an 18-week prison sentence, which was suspended for two years. He was also put under a lifetime ban which stops him from keeping animals.", "reference": "Neil Lewis's lodger Alexander Hammond brought kitten home in November .\nAs it grew older, Lewis developed a 'hatred' for the animal, court was told .\nThe 72-year-old put cat in a pet carrier before submerging it in River Colne .\nLewis, who has bipolar, told police it was a 'pain' and 'scratched things'"}

Pope Francis warned that corruption was a greater evil than sin and needed to be cured . He called for the abolition of capital punishment even describing imprisonment as its own death penalty . Pope Francis was addressing members of the International Association of Penal Law in the Vatican . He said: 'The scandalous accumulation of global wealth is possible because of the connivance of those with strong powers who are responsible for public affairs. The corrupt one does not perceive his own corruption. It is a little like what happens with bad breath: someone who has it hardly ever realises it; other people notice and have to tell him' 'Corruption is an evil greater than sin. More than forgiveness, this evil needs to be cured.' Pope Francis said some states used 'extra-judicial executions' as an unintended consequence of an action. He claimed that the death penalty has been used 'an instrument of suppression of political dissent or of persecution of religious or cultural minorities'. Pope Francis also warned against the use of pretrial detention. He said it is being used improperly as another form of unlawful punishment that is 'hidden behind legality'. He said: 'In the world today, torture is used not only as a means to achieve a particular purpose, such as a confession or an accusation—practices that are characteristic of a doctrine of national security — but also adds to the evil of detention.' He continued: 'Criminal code itself bears responsibility for having allowed, in certain cases, the legitimacy of torture under certain conditions, opening the way for further abuse.' He said: 'Caution in the application of penal codes must be the overarching principle of legal systems … and respect for human dignity must not only act to limit the arbitrariness and excesses of government agents but as the guiding criterion for prosecuting and punishing behaviors that represent the most serious attacks on the dignity and integrity of the human person.' Pope Francis said he believed the death penalty was an abuse of human rights and warned against the rise of 'penal populism' where politicians attempt to solve the problems in society by a tough stance on crime rather than following a path of social justice. He said the media and politicians advocated  'violence and revenge, public and private, not only against those responsible for crimes, but also against those under suspicion, justified or not'. Pope Francis said the criminal code should protect human dignity when instead it legitimises torture . Pope Francis warned that national security was being used as an excuse to perpetrate injustice . He said: 'It is impossible to imagine that states today cannot make use of another means than capital punishment to defend peoples’ lives from an unjust aggressor . 'All Christians and people of good will are thus called today to struggle not only for abolition of the death penalty, whether it be legal or illegal and in all its forms, but also to improve prison conditions, out of respect for the human dignity of persons deprived of their liberty. And this, I connect with life imprisonment. 'Life imprisonment is a hidden death penalty.' He said: 'The traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor that cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity are very rare, if not practically non-existent.'

{"id": 15267, "article": "Hundreds of infants and toddlers have reportedly been captured by border officers after crossing into the U.S. illegally from Mexico unaccompanied by an adult as a growing number of migrants from Central America overwhelm detention centers in Texas. The U.S. Border Patrol detained 378 children aged two or less who were traveling without a parent or guardian from Oct 1 through June 11, according to data obtained by Fusion from the office of a high-ranking Democratic senator who wasn't identified. Of those, 95 were under a year old. Parents may be sending their wee ones across the border in hopes they will be allowed to stay, fueled in part by misconceptions among migrants that people with children can enter the U.S. legally. Children detainees sleep in a holding cell at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas, earlier this month . The federal government will spend more than $1 billion this year feeding, clothing and otherwise babysitting the children until suitable adult guardians can be found. HHS claims 85 per cent of them are reunited with family members, but those are guardians in the United States, not in their home countries. The agency has not responded to requests for information about how many of them are themselves illegal aliens. The growing number of immigrants trying to make it into the U.S. is being driven in part by a misconception that children won't be deported. That's a misinterpretation of a 2012 policy that delays the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children prior to 2007. Still, unaccompanied children are more likely than adults to slip through the cracks and ultimately remain in the U.S. for months or even years. Once captured, most minors are processed and reunited with family members or a guardian in the U.S. while they await deportation proceedings. Detention facilities are generally not equipped to handle young people, especially infants and toddlers. But because of the significant backlog and lack of resources put into tracking them, few are expected to ever return and face immigration judges. Few of the children are expected to return to face immigration judges, according to the nation's largest border patrolman's union. In 2012 President Obama announced a policy intended to delay the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2007. But in a transnational game of 'telephone', that policy has been misinterpreted – in some cases willfully so, by 'coyotes' who make a living transporting immigrants into the U.S. – to suggest that it would apply equally to newly arriving minors. Rumors also persist that the U.S. will pass immigration reform that will grant migrants already within its borders amnesty and a right to remain. The steady stream of tens of thousands of . unaccompanied children is part of a recent surge in Central Americans . crossing into the U.S. via the . Rio Grande Valley in Texas. About 174,000 people have been arrested by . the Border Patrol there since Oct 1, including 52,000 children - a 99 per cent . increase from last year. Most of the migrants hail from Honduras, El . Salvador and Guatemala. The average age of an unaccompanied child is 14, according to Emily Butera, a senior program officer at the Women's Refugee Commission. The Obama Administration is trying to address the problem by combating the misinformation and opening new detention facilities designed for families in an effort to . process and deport them more quickly. The first one will be located on . the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's Artesia, New Mexico, . campus, according to The Wall Street Journal. At the moment, the Border Patrol is releasing many of them while they . await their deportation proceedings because there is no place to hold . them, making it easier for them to blend into the population and remain for years. Customs and Border Protection agents escort young detainees primarily from Central  America to an area to make phone calls . The . immigration agency currently has only one detention center designed for families, . an 85-bed facility in Pennsylvania. The rising number of migrants have overwhelmed U.S. authorities at the U.S.'s busiest corridor for crossings in South Texas, forcing them to seek out additional detention space. A plan to bus hundreds to an empty college campus in Lawrenceville, Virginia, was scrapped after a community backlash, according to CBS News. The government is also trying to ease agents' workload by flying hundreds of migrants to California for processing, the AP reported. Two flights on Monday will ferry about 140 Central American migrants to San Diego and a nearby town, according to Paul Beeson, chief of the Border Patrol for the California city. A toddler sits on the floor with other detainees at the Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas, on Wednesday . The flights are expected to continue every three days, primarily filled with families with young children, but no unaccompanied minors. Neither plan, however, will help address the growing number of children making the perilous journy across the border alone. Vice President Joe Biden met with Central American leaders in Guatemala on Friday in hopes of discouraging minors from making the voyage and emphasizing that traveling with children does not give migrants a free pass. Vice President Joe Biden visited Guatemala on Friday in an effort to stem the tide of Central American children and families crossing into the U.S. illegally . 'We . are prioritizing the need to resolve these cases…in light of the . humanitarian crisis caused by the number of crossings,' Mr Biden said. 'Make no mistake, once an individual's case is fully heard, and . if he or she does not qualify for asylum, he or she will be removed from . the United States and returned home.

{"id": 15268, "article": "In July, KDNuggets.com, an online newsite focused on data mining and analytics software, ran an unusual listing in its jobs section. \"We are looking for Predictive Modeling/Data Mining Scientists and Analysts, at both the senior and junior level, to join our department through November 2012 at our Chicago Headquarters,\" read the ad. \"We are a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians, predictive modelers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software developers, general analysts and organizers - all striving for a single goal: re-electing President Obama.\" The job listing caught the attention of Alex Lundry, a Republican data-mining expert at TargetPoint Consulting. He tweeted a link to the ad, commenting, \"The Obama campaign is taking #bigdata seriously; what about the GOP candidates?\" The question almost answers itself. So far in the presidential election of 2012, there is only one campaign that is doing cutting-edge work with data. Obama may be struggling in the polls and even losing support among his core boosters, but when it comes to the modern mechanics of identifying, connecting with and mobilizing voters, as well as the challenge of integrating voter information with the complex internal workings of a national campaign, his team is way ahead of the Republican pack. Facebook apps and other tools . Alone among the major candidates running for president, the Obama campaign not only has a Facebook page with 23 million \"likes\" (roughly 10 times the total of all the Republicans running), it has a Facebook app that is scooping up all kinds of juicy facts about his supporters. Users of the Obama 2012 - Are You In? app are not only giving the campaign personal data like their name, gender, birthday, current city, religion and political views, they are sharing their list of friends and information those friends share, like their birthday, current city, religion and political views. As Facebook is now offering the geo-targeting of ads down to ZIP code, this kind of fine-grained information is invaluable. Inside the Obama operation, his staff members are using a powerful social networking tool called NationalField, which enables everyone to share what they are working on. Modeled on Facebook, the tool connects all levels of staff to the information they are gathering as they work on tasks like signing up volunteers, knocking on doors, identifying likely voters and dealing with problems. Managers can set goals for field organizers -- number of calls made, number of doors knocked -- and see, in real time, how people are doing against all kinds of metrics. In additional to all the hard data, users can share qualitative information: what points or themes worked for them in a one-on-one conversation with voters, for example. \"Ups,\" \"Downs\" and \"Solutions\" are color-coded, so people can see where successes are happening or challenges brewing. And unlike an open social network, where everyone is equal, NationalField runs on a hierarchical social graph: Higher-level staff get a broader view of the state and local work below them. For a campaign that tapped the volunteer energies of millions of people in 2008 and appears to need all the help it can get in 2012, these kinds of fine-grained technologies could make a key difference. While the Republican field (and bloggers and the press) has been focused on how their candidates are doing with social networking, Obama's campaign operatives are devising a new kind of social intelligence that will help drive campaign resources where they are most needed. 'Data harmonization' It all sounds like common sense, but actually, connecting and synchronizing the data a campaign collects from its field operation, fundraising operation and Web operation isn't a trivial task. \"The holy grail of data analysis is data harmonization, or master data management,\" Lundry said. \"To have political talking to finance and finance talking to field, and data is flowing back and forth and informing the actions of each other -- it sounds easy, but it's incredibly hard to implement.\" Most political campaigns tend to rely on consultants to carry out part or all of these functions, resulting in even greater obstacles to sharing information. Like Lundry, Republican technology consultant Martin Avila is worried. His firm, Terra Eclipse, built Ron Paul's 2008 Web operation and works closely with the tea party movement. This year, it did some work on Tim Pawlenty's website until that campaign folded. Avila's flagship project is a conservative social-networking hub called Freedom Connector, which has grown to 150,000 members in a matter of months by giving right-wing activists tools to organize local meetings and discussions. Avila doesn't think any of the Republican presidential campaigns fully understand the power of data today. \"They have to stop seeing a website as a piece of direct mail that people will receive,\" he said. \"They have to see a website as the equivalent of a campaign office in Iowa, one that is open 24/7.\" And campaigns need to know how to take quick and well-targeted action to respond to every expression of interest they may get online, he argues, because voter interest in politicians is fickle. Simply sending a generic e-mail reply isn't enough. \"If you can make that initial response a phone call from someone in their town or a neighbor, asking them to come to a county fair tomorrow, that's much more powerful.\" Power of personal connections . Without good data management, the different legs of a national campaign can trip over each other. \"One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing quite often in campaigns,\" Lundry said. \"With master data management across a campaign, you can see how often you're talking to a person\" and thus not bombard them with untimely or poorly targeted requests. But, according to Avila, \"Not many on the Republican side know how to technically accomplish that.\" Their approach to the Web, he adds, is still too much shaped by pre-Internet politicking using broadcast advertising. \"The ability to connect to people on a one-to-one basis, and encourage them to connect with one another, is way more powerful than that.\" How powerful? The 2008 Obama campaign offered an early glimpse of the potential of data-driven politics. By the end of the election, it had amassed 13 million supporter e-mail addresses, collected nearly 4 million individual donations and tallied about 2 million registered users on my.BarackObama.com, the campaign's social networking platform. Seventy thousand myBO members had used the site to conduct their own personalized fundraising campaigns. Since 2008, enthusiasm for Obama has waned, but his online presence hasn't. His base on Facebook has soared nearly six times from the 4 million he had on Election Day, and his following on Twitter now stands at 10 million, dwarfing the Republican field. So even if Obama isn't drawing millions of people off their sofas to rally to his side on their own in 2012, his team has a huge amount of raw data to work with as they build his re-election machine. If the 2012 election comes down to a battle of inches, where a few percentage points change in turnout in a few key states making all the difference, we may come to see Obama's investment in predictive modelers and data scientists as the key to victory.", "reference": "In the mechanics of identifying voters, President Obama's team is ahead of GOP rivals .\nObama's re-election campaign is the only one doing cutting-edge work with data .\nPresident's operation uses a powerful social-networking tool called NationalField .\nExpert: GOP presidential campaigns don't fully understand power of data crunching ."}

{"id": 15270, "article": "(CNN)Photographers often go to bizarre lengths to earn the confidence of their subjects. Just ask Thomas Roma, who got on his knees and howled his way into the heart of a pit bull mix named Violet at a dog park in Brooklyn, New York. Something had to be done. Each time Roma showed up, Violet charged at him, barking and occasionally nipping at his legs. One day, Roma knelt down next to her and started to howl \"like a wolf,\" he said. She stopped \"dead in her tracks\" and joined him, starting a ritual that persists today. \"She matched me howl for howl, and immediately after that she just loved me,\" Roma said. Violet was one of many canine friends Roma made at Dyker Beach Park, where he spent three years shooting what he calls the most unexpected work of his career. The 64-year-old says he has spent most of his life looking through the viewfinder, \"hoping to be surprised\" by what he saw. \"Mondo Cane\" (\"A Dog's Life\") stands out in his oeuvre thanks to its perspective. To take the photos of the dogs and their shadows, he would mount a camera to the end of a pole, raising it up to 7 feet. \"The pleasure of it was learning new skills after all these years being a photographer,\" he said. \"And the dogs are just running around like maniacs. That's what's so great about it.\" Response to \"Mondo Cane\" also has been unusual, he said. The photos are being exhibited and sold in galleries in New York, Rome and Tokyo before he has had a chance to edit them into a book. That's a first in a career that began in the 1970s, when Roma left his job as a Wall Street trader to focus full-time on a hobby. Not that he's been struggling for recognition. He is a two-time Guggenheim fellow, and his work has been exhibited around the world and published in 13 books. As Columbia University's director of photography since 1996, he has also earned the admiration of many students, including one who started a Tumblr, \"S***t My Photography Professor Says,\" dedicated to his \"legitimately insane\" and \"legitimately brilliant\" classroom rants. Roma and his wife, Anna, started bringing their standard poodle to Dyker Beach Park about nine years ago, when Tino was just a puppy. Prospect Park was closer, but dogs have to be kept on leashes there, Roma said. At Dyker Beach, located in the southwest corner of Brooklyn near the Verrazano Bridge, Tino could roam free. Roma didn't start photographing the dogs until 2011, when he was nearly finished with another project and started fretting over what was next. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. One day, as the sun streamed unimpeded across the park, casting long canine shadows, he had a revelation. \"There was something about the primal nature of the shadows of these little lovable pets of ours. Their shadows, I felt, revealed a wilder side of their nature,\" he said. \"They immediately struck me as something like cave drawings.\" The powdery layer of dust on the ground made for a fresh canvas each day, Roma said. When he arrived in the morning, the wind had blown it smooth. As the hours went by, tracks from dogs and people brought to life new texture and form. \"What was interesting to me is I was essentially photographing the ground,\" he said. \"I would find interesting patches of ground and call the dogs over or follow them and get picture of what was actually there.\" He stopped photographing there last year when the city renovated the park, tearing up the ground and putting down a new surface.

The long squeeze on the incomes of millions of families is coming to an end, George Osborne said yesterday, as growth figures showed the recovery is gathering pace. The Office for National Statistics said Britain’s economy grew by 0.8 per cent between July and September, the fastest rate recorded since the election. Ministers seized on the figures as evidence that the Government’s austerity plan – which was bitterly opposed by Labour – is now bearing fruit. Let the good times roll? Chancellor George Osborne visits AW Hainsworth and Sons textile manufacturer in Leeds as figures show the recovery gaining momentum . Gains: Output in manufacturing is still 8.9 per cent lower than pre-recession levels, despite growing by 0.5 per cent in the latest quarter . The Chancellor said the recovery meant better times are in sight for millions of families who have seen their incomes squeezed since the 2008 crash. ‘Britain’s hard work is paying off,’ he said, adding: ‘If Britain is growing, then the finances of Britain’s families will start to grow.’ But Mr Osborne also warned that ‘lots of risks remain’, and said there was still a long way to go to eliminate the vast budget deficit left by Labour. David Cameron said the growth figure was ‘not just a number on a graph’, but evidence that a sustained recovery is finally underway. The Prime Minister said he was determined that the benefits of growth would be shared by all parts of the country. ‘The GDP figures out today do show our economy has real momentum,’ he said. ‘They show that we are on a path to prosperity. Boost: The British economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said today . Alex Brummer . George Osborne has every right to . declare Britain is back on the path  to prosperity after the economy . recorded robust growth across the board in the three months to . September. Remarkably, Britain is now among the fastest expanding of the G7 nations, easily outpacing rivals such as Germany and France. The . main driving force behind surging output is the service sector, which . comprises 75 per cent of the economy. That has now moved ahead of where . it was at the peak of Gordon Brown’s boom in 2008. The . turnabout in economic fortunes will come as a huge relief to the . Government, which has found itself on the back foot for the last week as . Britain’s Big Six energy firms raised prices. Labour’s . grudging response to nine months of solid output growth was to . acknowledge it as ‘good news’. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls could not . resist a dig, noting that for millions ‘standards of living are going . down, not up’. What . Balls forgets to say is that in the UK, unlike most of Europe, austerity . has been far less painful because employers have had the confidence to . expand the workforce. Some 1.4million private sector jobs have been . created since the Coalition came to office in 2010. The . faster the economy recovers, the better businesses will do and the . easier it will be to restore living standards through honestly earned . wage increases – rather than subsidy and welfare dependency. By far the . biggest net contributor to the UK’s economic renaissance is business . services – a sector often dismissed as coffee shops and haircuts. But . the reality is that it comprises IT, legal and accounting work, . engineering consultancy and architecture as well as some of the leading . creative industries. Many of these sell products overseas. The . figures also give the lie to the idea of a recovery built on a housing . bubble. While both housing and construction are gaining momentum, . growing by 2.5 per cent over the past three months, they are still 12.5 . per cent below the peak of the Blair-Brown bubble in 2008. There is also some evidence that the economy is starting to rebalance, with manufacturing perking up by 0.9 per cent. The . return to expansion is all the more encouraging in that the rest of . Europe (the UK’s biggest trading partner) is still in slump and the US . economy has been subsiding amid serious budget uncertainty. Mr . Osborne will, for the first time since becoming Chancellor, have far . better growth forecasts to present in his autumn statement on December . 4. There may even be a better outcome for the budget deficit as consumer . and income tax receipts pick up. ‘We’ve got a huge amount more to do to secure that recovery. Above all, our work here in Europe and at home is about making sure it is a recovery for all – a recovery for north and south, for rich and poor, for people who have been excluded from our economy.’ The strengthening recovery is a major blow to the strategy of Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who has repeatedly warned the Government’s austerity programme would strangle growth. Yesterday Mr Balls gave the ONS figures a cautious welcome, but warned that most families are still not feeling the benefit. Squeeze: The Consumer Prices Index shows the cost of living is up 2.7 per cent, while wages are rising by less than one per cent . Mr Balls said: ‘For millions of people across the country, still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all.’ Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable also struck a cautious note, saying: ‘We’ve always said the road to recovery would be a marathon, not a sprint.’ Economic growth in the third quarter of this year is the fastest since spring 2010, built on 0.7 per cent growth in the second quarter of the year and 0.4 per cent in the first three months. Ridicule: The Tories will take aim at Labour in an internet cartoon film entitled 'Mystic Ed, The World's Worst Clairvoyant' Falling: Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show how the government is on course to borrow less this year than last year . The ONS report showed all the main strands of the economy growing, with output in the dominant services sector up 0.7 per cent, manufacturing 0.9 per cent and construction 2.5 per cent. Analysts said housebuilding was boosted by a surge in mortgage lending on the back of state-supported schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy. But the economy is still 2.5 per cent smaller than it was in 2008 when boom turned to bust under Labour. Struggling: Inflation is higher in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, with food and energy driving up costs . Output shrank by 7.2 per cent in the recession and Britain remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century. The recent revival in Britain’s economic fortunes has fuelled speculation that an early rise in interest rates is on the cards. But, speaking on Thursday night just hours before the GDP figures were published, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the economy still lacks enough ‘traction’ to warrant a rate increase. Big rises in energy prices are ‘morally wrong’ David Cameron said yesterday as senior sources said he was preparing to slash the average bill by £50. The Prime Minister took aim at the Big Six energy companies, accusing them of putting up bills by far more than the amount wholesale gas prices have risen. At a press conference in Brussels, Mr Cameron confirmed he wants to remove onerous green levies from the cost of fuel to cut prices for families. But he also admitted the costs were likely to be passed to general taxation.nPower has announced it will increase energy bills by 10.4 per cent from December, while British Gas, Scottish Power and SSE have all announced rises of between 8 and 9 per cent this winter. Asked if such rises were ‘morally wrong’ when wholesale prices have risen by 3 per cent in recent months, Mr Cameron said: ‘On power bills, I think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially.’ The controversial HS2 rail line ‘can’t go ahead’ if Labour withdraws its support, David Cameron admitted yesterday. The Prime Minister, who also faces a major Tory rebellion on the £42billion project next week, said the scheme could collapse unless it retains all-party support. He said: ‘These multi-year, multi-parliament infrastructure projects, they can’t go ahead without all-party support, we won’t get the investment, we can’t have the consistency.’ Speculation is mounting that Labour is preparing to drop its backing for the project, which began life under the last Labour government. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls yesterday said it was ‘irresponsible’ of ministers to pledge to press ahead regardless of cost. Labour sources say Ed Miliband has ‘sub-contracted’ the final decision on HS2 to Mr Balls. Mr Cameron warned Labour would damage Britain’s long-term prospects if it pulled the plug on the scheme. He said they  would be ‘letting down’ the Midlands and the North and would be turning their backs on business.", "reference": "Third quarter data follows growth of 0.4% and 0.7% already this year .\nBoost for George Osborne's economic strategy that recovery is taking hold .\nBut Chancellor warns against giveaways with more 'difficult' cuts ahead .\nHe hails data as proof that 'the country is on the path to prosperity'\nBut voters not feeling the recovery, with wages outstripped by rising bills ."}

Obesity costs the state £5bn a year (stock photo) Thousands of people who say they are too fat to work are costing taxpayers nearly £30m a year, new figures show. Statistics issued by the Department for Work and Pensions show that a total of 7,080 people claimed £29.3m sickness benefits for obesity in the year to April 2012. Critics said it was time 'people took responsibility for their actions', as it emerged that the number of people claiming they were too obese to work had doubled in three years. Obesity costs the taxpayer more than £5bn a year, with many obese people relying on benefits entirely, as well as needing expensive healthcare, equipment and carers. The Government is keen to cut the enormous welfare bill, which comprises payments made under the Disability Living Allowance, Severe Disability Living Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance. April will see the introduction of the the Personal Independence Payment for those 'of working age', ie aged between 16-64.  It will replace the Disability Living Allowance and will be paid out only after a face-to-face consultation with a trained assessor. Six out of ten people will have their benefits reduced or even stopped as ministers try to drive down the benefits bill. The new DWP statistics, which were released in response to a Freedom of Information request, showed that last year's incapacity benefit bill topped £22bn - an increase of £1.4bn from the previous year. The constituency with the highest number of people claiming incapacity benefits is Knowsley on Merseyside, where 21,6000 receive payments.  Next up was Glasgow East with 19,830 and then Walton, Liverpool, with 19,360. Birmingham also had high numbers of claimants, along with Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Rhondda Valley and Sunderland. Going up: Britain is the obesity capital of Europe, with one in four adults classed as obese (stock photo) Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Obesity is costing taxpayers dear. Tackling the problem early is vital as it's not fair on the claimant or other taxpayers that someone is allowed to become dependent on benefits because of their weight. 'Ultimately people have to take responsibility for their actions and show they are taking steps to get back to work. For too long the benefits system has been quick to write people off and put them on the sick. This has to stop.' In October 2011 the Government launched a Call to Action campaign to tackle obesity and reduce the nation's calorie intake by 2020. Ministers called on food producers to cut the calories in food and drink, and to help people make healthier choices. Too fat to work: Paul Mason had to quit his job as a postman when he could no longer deliver letters . Paul Mason, 51, from Ipswich, had to give up his job as a postman when he became too fat to complete his delivery rounds. He says a compulsive eating disorder made him eat ten times more food than he needed until he was unable to walk or even stand, and had to be cared for full-time at home. At the height of his weight problems he ate about 20,000 calories a day, weighed 70 stone, and needed a specially-built bungalow provided for him by the council. When Mr Mason became ill, firefighters had to knock down a wall in his house and use a forklift truck to get him to hospital. Three years ago, he had a gastric bypass on the NHS and slimmed to 25 stone, but now he wants another operation to trim his excess skin. He said: 'It needs doing now, and probably in another four or five years - it doesn't matter how much toning up you do, it's only going to get worse.' Mr Mason, who once held the title of world's fattest man, is said to have cost taxpayers more than £1m in benefits.  When his weight was at its peak, he needed two full-time carers and specialist medical equipment and housing estimated to cost £100,000 a year.", "reference": "A total of 7,080 people claimed £29.3m in one year - and the figure is rising .\nNumber of claimants has doubled in three years, according to DWP stats .\nGoverment vows to slash welfare bill with new payment system in April ."}
{"id": 15273, "article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- In most households, photo albums sit on shelves or in drawers for years on end collecting dust. Jonas Cuarón, son of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón, with his girlfriend, Eireann Harper, who starred in \"Año Uña.\" Jonás Cuarón has put his own to much better use -- the 25-year-old son of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón has turned his collection of family photographs into a feature film. During the making of \"Año Uña,\" Cuarón walked around, camera in hand for a period of twelve months, randomly capturing scenes from his personal life. At the end of the year he and his girlfriend Eireann Harper mounted thousands of these images in a room and wrote a fictional story to accompany them. The final product is a most unusual film -- a montage of stills, brought to life through a mixture of dialogue, narration and sound effects. The story is that of an impossible love relationship between a 24-year-old American girl (Harper) and a Mexican teenager played by Jonás' half-brother, Diego Cataño. \"A common thing I hear from people who have seen the movie, is that the first five minutes they're very worried that they'll have to sit through eighty minutes of photographs,\" Cuarón explained to CNN, \"But then by minute seven they forget they're watching stills and become engaged with the characters.\" Watch Jonás Cuarón talking about \"Ano Uno.\" Amongst those engrossed by \"Año Uña\" are some of contemporary Mexican cinema's most iconic figures. The likes of Alejandro González Iñárritu and Gael García Bernal have championed the film for its originality. While Jonás' family ties have undoubtedly been of much use in promoting \"Año Uña\" amongst the great and good of Mexican cinema, his father's influence on the film itself is minimal. Although Alfonso is credited as its producer, the renowned director knew nothing of the project during its production. \"Jonás showed me the final film and I said 'Yikes! Look at that. You made a film. Show it to people you trust like Alejandro González Iñárritu , Guillermo del Toro, just for feedback.' That was as far as the consultancy went,\" Alfonso Cuarón told CNN. Father and son worked together previously on \"The Shock Doctrine,\" a political short film released on YouTube. Unlike \"Año Uña,\" the project involved a more traditional form of collaboration between Jonás as director Alfonso as producer. When asked about their working relationship, Alfonso's response is filled with enthusiasm: \"Usually one of us throws an idea and the other catches it and throws it back. It's telepathic in a way, we learn a lot from each other. \"Something that really fascinates me, not only about Jonás, but his entire generation, is how they work with their formats.\" Indeed, Jonás' ambition to break with the conventions of filmmaking is in line with a trend emerging amongst young filmmakers not only in Mexico, but across the world. According to Jonás this willingness to experiment is rooted in technological advances: \"[In the past] filmmakers had really complicated screenplays and they would wait for grants and finance support. \"Now since video is not as expensive, people are starting to go out and film reality without a script, and then out of that reality, editing it and finding the story as they go.\" In order to give such creative talent more exposure, the Cuaróns recently launched a competition -- the 'Año Uña' Short Film Competition -- that challenges young filmmakers to step in Jonas' footsteps. Aspiring writers and directors are encouraged to submit an \"Año Uña\"-like short film made entirely from photographic stills. The winning submission will be screened at the premiere of \"Año Uña\" later this month. In addition to promoting his own film, Jonás is convinced that the contest will create opportunities for his peers: \"I'm thrilled that this short film competition will open doors for filmmakers to play with new languages and demonstrate that the creative process of filmmaking can be more accessible than is often assumed.\" Despite Jonás' position at the helm of this innovative community, he says would like to try using more traditional methods on his next film project. \"Well, next time I would like to start with a screenplay and shoot 24 frames per second,\" he says with a smile, \"I don't think that you necessarily need to go as far as using still images to find new languages in film.\" Jonás may be laying the family photo album aside but the family legacy looks set to thrive regardless. With not one, but three Cuaróns (Alfronso's brother Carlos is also a filmmaker) mixing up the cinematic landscape, filmmaking may well be in for a make-over.

{"id": 15274, "article": "(CNN) -- A Louisiana justice of the peace who drew criticism for refusing to marry an interracial couple has resigned, the secretary of state's office said Tuesday. Keith Bardwell resigned in person at the Louisiana secretary of state's office, said spokesman Jacques Berry. The state Supreme Court will appoint an interim justice of the peace to fill Bardwell's position, Berry said, and a special election will be held next year to fill the position permanently. Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to perform a marriage ceremony for Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond, Louisiana, and sign their marriage license. The two were married by another justice of the peace. The couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against Bardwell and his wife, Beth Bardwell, on October 20, claiming the two violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Bardwell, speaking to CNN affiliate WBRZ, said he was advised \"that I needed to step down because they was going to take me to court, and I was going to lose.\" \"I would probably do the same thing again,\" he said. \"I found out I can't be a justice of the peace and have a conscience.\" Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had called for Bardwell's dismissal, said Tuesday night that \"Bardwell has finally consented to the will of the vast majority of Louisiana citizens and nearly every governmental official in Louisiana. Bardwell's refusal to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples was out of step with our Louisiana values and reflected terribly on our state. We are better off without him in public service.\" Initial reports were that Bardwell refused to issue a marriage license to the couple, but in the lawsuit Humphrey and McKay say they obtained the license from the parish court clerk's office and contacted Bardwell to see if he would perform the ceremony and sign the license to legally validate the marriage. Humphrey wound up speaking by telephone with Beth Bardwell, the lawsuit said, and Beth Bardwell asked Humphrey if they were a \"mixed couple.\" When told they were an interracial couple, Beth Bardwell said, according to the lawsuit, \"We don't do interracial weddings,\" and told her the two would have to go outside the parish to marry. Bardwell did not return repeated phone calls from CNN in October, but told CNN affiliate WAFB that he had no regrets about the decision. \"It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,\" he said. In addition, he told the Hammond Daily Star in an October story that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children that might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. \"I'm not a racist,\" he said. \"I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children.\" Humphrey said in October that she wanted Bardwell to resign. \"He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist,\" she said. According to the lawsuit, Bardwell estimated he refused to marry at least four other interracial couples in the past 2½ years. \"Defendant Beth Bardwell ... aided, abetted and conspired with defendant Keith Bardwell to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected civil rights,\" according to the suit. No response to the suit has been filed, and it was unclear whether the Bardwells had retained an attorney. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, claiming that Humphrey and McKay suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said he believed Bardwell should lose his license, and the National Urban League called for an investigation into the incident by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, saying in a statement that Bardwell's actions were \"a huge step backward in social justice.\" According to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black. The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially-based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 ruling in the case Loving v. Virginia. In the unanimous decision, the court said that under the Constitution, \"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.\" CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.", "reference": "Keith Bardwell resigns in person at Louisiana secretary of state's office, official says .\nBardwell refused to marry couple after he found they were of different races .\nThey filed federal lawsuit; Louisiana governor called for Bardwell to resign ."}

Cambridge and Bristol have been revealed as the most expensive student cities in Britain. New research has revealed the true disparity in the real cost of studying at some of the UK’s top universities. The study, based on the 24-strong elite Russell Group of universities has shown that Cambridge and Bristol have beaten London into third place as the UK’s most expensive student cities based on the cost of renting a bedroom. Cambridge University is the most expensive university town costing around £97.25 in rent a week . Cambridge, home of the second most academically ranked university after Oxford, is the most expensive with a bedroom in a privately rented home costing on average £97.25 per week – more than £20 higher than the national average of £75.25. However, the university says most of its students rent from colleges and pay the £97.25 figure for only 30 weeks of term. Compared to Liverpool, rated 29th in the academic rankings, where a room rental costs £54.25 per week, people living in Cambridge are paying 79 per cent higher rents which amounts to £2,236 extra spent over the course of a year.

Within London, the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is slightly cheaper in terms of tuition costs, falling £500 per year lower than most of the Russell Group universities, who charge £9,000 for a Bachelor of Arts course. But this saving is more than swallowed up by the £2,236 more it costs to rent in the capital. Unsurprisingly, the most expensive student pint can be found at London’s universities, where at an average of £3.60 for a lager, the student loan has further to stretch compared to students of Cardiff University, who pay £1.35 less for their city centre pint. According to haart, parents are buying properties in the best value university towns for their children to live which can then be rented out when they leave. Paul Smith, CEO of haart estate agent which carried out the research, said: 'Many canny parents are taking advantage of the strong rental markets by buying a home where their children are studying and letting the property to their offspring and their friends. 'This pays for a ‘discounted’ rent for their child and offers a long-term investment for them. 'For those students looking to save money on their rental expenses and their social life, our tip is to study in Leeds, where average rent is £58.50 and the beer averages £2.45 a pint, £1.15 less than London and 30p less than Glasgow.'

{"id": 15277, "article": "By . Robert Hardman . Flying low over the ocean formerly known as Somerset, we come to the frontline of this epic battle. And this really is a battlefield. Down below, entire squadrons of bulldozers and diggers are constructing a vast dam – a Hadrian’s Wall of mud – for mile after mile in order to prevent an enemy assault on nearby Bridgwater. The water has just swamped the main railway line outside the town, and a line has to be drawn somewhere. Fortress in the floods: A mud wall is all that separates this home from disaster in Somerset . A little to the north, an 18-vehicle convoy of juggernauts has just arrived from Holland carrying one of the largest water pumps ever seen in the British Isles. Are we looking at D-Day – or Dunkirk? Either way, it has come too late for those villages and farms which are already in occupied territory. Yesterday, the waters on the Somerset Levels just carried on rising and a steady stream of tearful, angry residents continued to head for dry land, surrendering to the elements. With one exception. As of last night, Sam Notaro was still cheerfully holding out behind surely the most extraordinary piece of DIY since Noah’s Ark. Having recently built the house of his dreams for his young family, Sam has encircled his pride and joy with a six-foot wall of mud and rocks which has now featured in bulletins and newspapers around the world. And it was still getting higher as dusk fell yesterday evening. As I later discover, the whole thing might be considerably taller still had it not been for an executive at the Environment Agency who held things up for a day because Sam had not obtained the requisite permit for earth-moving. Is it any wonder the agency’s management is regarded with such contempt in these parts? Sam has been nicknamed ‘King Canute’, much to his amusement. Protected: An aerial view of Sam Notaro's house on the edge of the village of Moorland which was evacuated on Friday . But Canute famously ordered the waves to halt and failed. Sam, on the other hand, appears to be winning. I’d say he’s more like Churchill. He’s certainly fighting them on the beaches. Just don’t bring up the Dambusters here at Dyers Farm. From my helicopter cockpit, I can see the waves lapping at the top of his ramparts, while Sam and his father and a couple of friends take it in turns to scoop up more and more mud with a pair of increasingly submerged diggers. After weekend storms brought big waves crashing in from the west, they have even built themselves a new breakwater and outer wall. What are spirits like down inside this besieged little plot? It’s impossible to touch down because the garden is completely waterlogged and the helicopter pilot fears he could get bogged down. So I plot an amphibious landing. Working my way round to the outskirts of the drowned village of Moorland, I meet Sam as he comes ashore to pick up some more diesel for his water pumps. He’s from a big family of local builders and the whole lot have rallied round. Mum’s put together a few bags of supplies – pizzas, bread, tomatoes and a couple of bottles of wine. What he’d really like now, says Sam, is some fresh socks. ‘I haven’t felt dry for a week – and I do miss my babies,’ adds the 40-year-old father of two small girls. Never give up: Sam Notaro and his father Joe in front of his home . He moved them and his partner, Alana, . to temporary digs last week. ‘I was feeling a bit down last night. It . was like the North Sea coming straight at us and I thought the waves . might break through. But we held out and we managed to get the second . digger in today and that’s cheered me up.’ As . we prepare to set sail, a couple of his neighbours are coming ashore in . a police rescue boat. ‘Goodbye, Sam. Don’t know when I’ll be back,’ says a lady called Lorraine, doing her best to put on a brave face. Her voice starts to crack as she explains that she’d only just installed a new kitchen. Sam offers his condolences. The whole area is in a state of bereavement. We set off in a boat skippered by Sam’s friend, Craig Fleming. A car dealer by trade, Craig has been helping out for a few days, staying up all the previous night to monitor the pumps so that Sam could grab some sleep. Poor Moorland is a dismal sight as we sail down the main road. Many people didn’t even manage to get their cars out in time. We turn towards Dyers Farm and the house is a truly surreal sight poking out of the sea – like Mont Saint-Michel with a four-bedroom executive home on top. When he started building this house four years ago, Sam worked out the highest point that flood waters had ever reached in these parts and then added on another foot. ‘I did apply to go three feet higher but the planning people wouldn’t have it.’ In some places beyond the wall, the water is now five feet over the ground and still climbing. This village in Somerset has been left devastated by the rising water levels has been virtually abandoned . We moor at ‘the jetty’, a series of pallets laid over the dam. The photographer steps on to the mud and promptly goes up to his thigh in gloop. It’s not the easiest landing. Inside the stockade, there’s a couple of inches of water on the ground but the house itself has been completely sealed up with sandbags and polythene. ‘Would you mind taking off your boots?’ asks Sam as we reach the entrance. I assume he is joking but he isn’t. Inside, it is a very warm, very tidy, very clean and rather empty house. All the furniture, it turns out, has been carried upstairs. The paintings are still on the walls, as is a television. Over a cup of tea in the spacious kitchen, with its panoramic sea view beyond the dyke, Sam’s father, Joe, 62, vents his exasperation. The family are deeply appreciative of the efforts of two local Environment Agency officials, both called Steve, who have helped them bring in pumps and sandbags. ‘They’ve been brilliant. It’s the people at the top who drive us mad,’ says Joe. Setting aside the now unimpeachable . arguments for dredging, he tells me how he had arranged for several . lorryloads of earth and clay to come in here last Tuesday as soon as it . was clear that the entire village was going to be submerged. Last man standing: The 40-year-old looks out of his recently constructed £1million house . ‘Then the contractor called me and said that he couldn’t deliver the earth because Sam and I didn’t have a permit from the Environment Agency. I called the agency and was told I could be fined £30,000 if I didn’t get a permit.’ The permit – to ensure that the earth was not in any way contaminated – would take six to eight weeks to be processed. A day later, after a series of increasingly frantic calls to different parts of the agency, an official finally agreed to waive the demand for a permit. Joe’s lorries finally arrived and Sam could start work on his dam. ‘These officials just don’t have a clue,’ sighs Joe. ‘They’re more worried about wildlife. I love wildlife, too – I wouldn’t even kill a spider – but they need a businessman running that agency. Someone who gets things done.’ Looking at the extraordinary earthworks taking shape around me, I suspect the agency could do with a Notaro or two, instead of the floundering Lord Smith. Between them, Sam and Joe have built their own mini-Netherlands in less than a week. Last night, Sam and his crew had another setback as one of his water pumps packed up. Today, if the floods are still rising, the diggers may have to leave before the water gets into the engines. ‘But we’re still in with a chance,’ says Sam, adding that the locals are very grateful for all the support from the Mail and its readers. ‘We’re still fighting.’", "reference": "Sam Notaro was holding out behind his six-foot defences built out of mud .\nWall circling his home means he is only resident left in village of Moorland .\nHis mother has given him supplies including bottles of wine and pizza .\nBut claims all he wants now is a fresh pair of socks ."}
{"id": 15278, "article": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Babies lie side by side in warming beds or sprawled on blankets atop crude wooden tables. Many families at Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, seem resigned to the situation. Children with wounds and broken bones are carried in by their parents to wait on stiff plastic chairs. Outside, coughing youngsters squat on the pavement with their anxious families, waiting for care. And everywhere, parents clutch plastic bags containing bring-your-own medicines and supplies. For though they are all awaiting treatment at Afghanistan's only specialist pediatric hospital, the hospital cannot even afford bandages for its patients. The Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in central Kabul has to run on an operating budget of less than $1,200 a month, said Dr. Noorulhaq Yousufzai, the hospital director. The few supplies that he can buy have to be hoarded for emergencies, and he has to count on parents to buy what's needed to care for their children. \"In some cases, there is shortage of the surgical materials, and sometimes we don't have antiseptic to use,\" Yousufzai said. The United Nations says that more than $15 billion in aid has been sent to Afghanistan since the U.S.-led coalition overthrew the Taliban in late 2001. But still, the hospital cannot afford to help the hundreds of children who stream in every day, desperate for care and cures. The government does pay for salaries and sometimes for fuel, but there is often a shortage of even basic supplies like syringes. Doctors say they have to double up premature babies in incubators. And some of those incubators are compromised. On a recent day, a plastic surgical mask taped onto one machine was the only shield from infection.  Watch scenes from inside the hospital » . The parents waiting anxiously beside their sick children seem resigned to the situation in the hospital. One mother, who declined to give her name, said she spent the family's entire weekly income of $8 on an injection that did not help her baby. \"This is something that the hospital should be giving us, because we can't afford it,\" she said. The U.S. Agency for International Development says infant mortality has dropped by 22 percent since the overthrow of the Taliban but acknowledges that the health status for Afghans is among the worst in the world. One in every five Afghan children will die before their 5th birthday, often of a preventable disease, according to the Save the Children aid agency. The toll on the children and parents is clear to any visitor, and the strain hits the hospital staff, too. \"When you see a patient is very, very, sick and you cannot help, and they have to provide something for their children and they are not able to provide, it's also a stress for us,\" Yousufzai said. At the end of 2001, there were hopes that the hospital would be upgraded, but it is still waiting. It needs some acute care of its own, or it will continue to struggle to help the children who arrive at its door pleading for care.", "reference": "Kabul hospital's operating budget is less than $1,200 a month .\nGovernment pays salaries, but even basic supplies are often gone .\nOne in five Afghan children will die before their 5th birthday, group says ."}

Nadal was in deep trouble in the third and deciding set before pulling out a 2-6 6-3 7-5 victory. The world number one admitted that the back problem which affected him during his Australian Open final defeat to Stanislas Wawrinka was still leaving him with doubts. \"I was a little bit scared for the back. I am not yet 100 per cent confident with my service,\" he told gathered reporters after serving eight double faults in the two hour 40 minute encounter. Stepanek, 35, also posed an unusual challenge as Nadal acknowledged: \"He is not the right player to play against in the first match because what you want to find is rhythm and against him every point is different.\" Stepanek swept through the first set before Nadal hit back to level and take a break lead in the third set. Stepanek broke back then forced three break points on the Spaniard's service in the sixth game. \"It's true that with love-40, I was very close to losing, to being out, but I think I did two good serves and then I played a great point,\" said Nadal. \"Tough one.

{"id": 15280, "article": "Samsung was among the first major techs firm to jump on the smartwatch bandwagon, but its square designs have regularly been criticised for being too clunky. It’s no surprise then that Samsung has filed numerous patents for wrist-worn gadgets with circular faces. The latest, filed in March last year and awarded this week, details what Samsung calls its 'new design' and reveals a round watch with a sensor in the band. The patent was filed by the South Korean tech giant in March last year and awarded this week. It reveals what the firm calls its 'new design’ and shows a circular face. In the files, a selection of images reveal the front, rear, left and right-side (pictured) views . In the files, titled ‘The ornamental design for an electronic device, as shown and described’ images reveal the top front, front, rear, left, and right-side views. In May, a patent detailed a Samsung smartwatch that didn't need a phone to work. Later the same month, images in another patent revealed this rumoured device may not even need a touchscreen. According to the application, the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device. These sensors could recognise flicks, waves and other movements, and the files claim a depth sensor, when combined with a camera, for example, could be used to detect what a user is pointing at. It resembles the rounded design of the Moto 360, expected ‘later this summer’ - but was filed before the Moto 360 was officially unveiled. The patent was also filed before Samsung released its square Galaxy Gear and Gear range of watches, so it is unclear if a round watch is in the making, or was only proposed. In a number of the images in the latest patent, a sensor can be seen fitted to the wristband. This could be a camera, similar to the one built into the top panel on the Gear 2, or a heart rate sensor, as seen on the rear of the Galaxy S5 phone.

The patent doesn't reveal any specifics of the device, but previous patents and products suggest what it may feature. For example, it’s likely any rounded watch will run either Tizen or Android Wear. Samsung's Gear 2, for example, runs on the former, while the Gear Live is powered by the latter. It could also be the first standalone Samsung smartwatch to not need a phone to work.

Protest of innocence: Bill Boal, pictured here arriving for trial in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was accused of taking part in the Great Train Robbery . The family of a man convicted over the Great Train Robbery have launched a fresh appeal nearly 50 years on to clear his name, with one gang member declaring 'he had absolutely nothing to do with it'. Bill Boal was one of 12 men jailed for the audacious crime in August 1963, which resulted in the gang taking £2.5 million from the Glasgow-to-London Night Mail train. Boal, who was sentenced to 24 years - later reduced to 14 on appeal - died in 1970 from cancer while still in prison. He always protested his innocence. Now robber Roger Cordrey's son Tony has spoken out by stating what Boal's family always believed - that the engineer from Fulham, west London was not involved in the robbery. Speaking to the Sunday People, he said: 'Bill was totally innocent. Dad said many, many times Bill had absolutely nothing to do with the robbery.' His statement comes as Boal's family revealed they are preparing a file asking the Criminal Case Review Commission to look again at their father’s case. If successful, they hope to convince the Appeal Court to reverse his conviction and clear his name. It will include testimony from gang members and include evidence ruled out of the original trial. Boal was convicted after the police . found him with Cordery's car, which contained £141,000 - his friend's share of the massive haul. He always maintained that he was unaware of the stolen money - and other gang members have supported this. Nick Reynolds, the son of convicted robber Bruce Reynolds, told the Sunday People: 'Bill never played any part in it and the rest of the guys were completely stunned when he was convicted.' Bill Boal always protested his innocence, but was convicted, jailed for 24 years and died in prison from cancer . Police lead away three of the 12 men convicted of the audacious crime . Crime of the century: The Royal Mail train targeted by robbers nearly 50 years ago . Reynolds, who died earlier this year aged 81, also left a hand-written statement confirming Boal was never involved. Boal's family hope the relatives of other gang members will now come forward to help their fight for justice. His son David, 62, said Boal's conviction 'virtually destroyed' his life and those of his mother Renee, his brother Anthony and sister, Debbie. 'We carry the scars – some of them very open and very real – to this day.' Boal met Cordrey after lodging with his family in Hampton, west London. The two became friends and shared a love of racing, snooker and gambling. Both their worlds were shattered following the events of August 8, 1963, dubbed by police as 'the crime of the century'. Hideout: Leatherslade Farm in Buckinghamshire was used by the gang in the days following the robbery . The gang laid low for five days at Leatherslade Farm – 17 miles from the ambush site near Ledburn, Beds – before splitting the money and dispersing. Soon afterwards, Cordrey rang Boal to tell him he could repay a debt that he owed his friend. He invited Boal to join him in a 'project' in Bournemouth – and Bill decided to combine it with a family trip to the seaside. They travelled by train to Oxford, where Cordrey met them in his new Rover. Boal's son Anthony noticed bags and cases, which he thought were filled with fishing tackle for their trip. There were so many that the children had to sit on them during the trip to Dorset. In fact the bags contained the stolen money, which would be worth £2.6million today. Once they arrived in Bournemouth, Boal sent his wife and children to the beach while Cordrey asked him to help him find a garage and flat to rent and to buy another car. Defending Boal: Roger Cordrey (third from right) told his son Tony that Boal was not involved in the robbery. Also pictured are fellow gang members Buster Edwards, Tom Wisbey, Jim White, Bruce Reynolds, Charles Wilson and Jim Hussey . Boal's sons believe Cordrey also gave their father £220, with a promise of giving him another £430 in another couple of days, to repay the entire debt. But within a week of the robbery, both were arrested after offering to pay cash for three months’ rent on a lock-up garage. The owner was a policeman’s widow, who became suspicious of the amount of money owned by the pair.Two years later, Boal told a lawyer that he had only stayed with Cordrey because he believed his debt would eventually be settled. Boal died in June 1970, four months after Jack Mills, the train driver who violently coshed in the robbery. Victim: Bruce Reynolds, pictured with his wife Angela prior to his death earlier this year, maintained that Boal was innocent in his autobiography . He protested his innocence until the end and had written letters addressed to the European Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the Official Solicitor. Gang member Bruce Reynolds also spoke of Boal as a 'victim' in his autobiography: 'Bill Boal was a victim of the judicial process. 'And while we, the Great Train Robbers, accept responsibility for injuring Jack Mills, I’ve yet to hear of anyone ­accepting responsibility for what was done to Bill Boal.'", "reference": "Bill Boal was one of 12 convicted for the audacious crime in August 1963 .\nThe gang stole £2.5million from the Glasgow-to-London Night Mail train .\nBoal died from cancer in 1970, still protesting his innocence .\nRobber Roger Cordrey's son Tony has spoken out in defence of Boal .\nEngineer jailed after he was found with Cordrey's car containing £141,000 ."}

Mr Payne was briefly in the pubic eye during the President's first election campaign when Obama mistakenly said his great-uncle had liberated Auschwitz.

When he was just 20, Mr Payne, had in fact helped free prisoners at Ohrdruf, a section of the Buchenwald concentration camp where an estimated 56,545 people were killed by the SS. It was Soviet forces who liberated Auschwitz in January 1945 as they marched across Nazi-occupied Poland. Mr Payne, who is the brother of Obama's maternal grandmother Madelyn Dunham, said at the time that he was 'truly astonished' by the attention paid to the gaffe, and called his nephew 'truly an astounding young man'. The veteran modestly played down his role in the liberation of Ohrdruf, but described the horrors he saw there, including a circle of dead inmates in rags that had clearly been near starvation when they were killed. He said: 'They were there with their tin cups like they were called to get food, then had been machine gunned. 'Nothing but just skin over bones with nothing, no flesh at all.' During his first election campaign, Obama mistakenly said that Mr Payne had helped free prisoners at Auschwitz, but quickly corrected himself . After the war, Mr Payne went to college in Kansas, where he had grown up. He went on to graduate at the University of Chicago, where Obama would later lecture on constitutional law.

It was the shocking discovery that tore two families apart and forever changed the security procedures of U.S. hospitals. Now, 18 years later, America's most widely-reported case of two children who were switched at birth continues to remain relevant - and one of the girls has given a rare interview about how it has affected her as an adult. Callie Johnson was just three-years-old when single mother Paula Johnson discovered the toddler was not biologically hers. Her biological parents were Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers, and the daughter they took home and raised, Rebecca, was actually Paula's birth child. Scroll down for video . Now: Callie Johnson is 18 and has given her first interview about being switched at birth. She has spoken about the love and gratitude she has for her mother Paula, who discovered her daughter was not actually hers when Callie was three . Then: This picture of Callie (left) and Paula Johnson (right) was taken around the same time in 1998 that Paula discovered the little girl she had been raising for three years was not actually her own . The biological parents: Kevin Rogers (left) and Whitney Chittum (right) were 18 and 16 respectively when they had their first child in 1995. While they took home Rebecca, (bottom left) their biological daughter was actually Callie . But in a tragic twist of fate, Kevin and Whitney, along with four other relatives, died in a shocking car crash the same day the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville discovered they had switched the children shortly after their birth in June 1995. It meant the couple died without knowing the mistake that had been made and that Rebecca would grow up without her 'parents'. Today Callie is 18, living on her own in Richmond, Virginia and is planning on going to culinary school, but 'adoptive' mom Paula who raised her remains the single biggest person in her life. 'The big question everyone always asks me is 'Would you prefer your parents still be alive or passed?' she said in an interview this week with CBS 6. Devastating: In a horrible coincidence, Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a shocking car crash the day it was discovered their child had been switched at birth and they never found out the truth. The car they were traveling in collided with a truck during wet weather on Interstate 81 near Roanoke in North Carolina . Write caption here . Pressure: The University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville came under intense scrutiny after it was made public at a press conference in 1998 they had accidentally switched two babies in the maternity ward three years earlier . 'I don’t know what I’m missing so in a sense, I do feel more sorry for Rebecca, because she doesn’t know her biological mom.' National headlines: The story was major news, even partially eclipsing the Monica Lewinsky affair, which happened around the same time . Paula said she 'does not have a relationship' with Rebecca following years of trying to get custody of her as a child. Conversely, Paula is more than just a mom to Callie. 'She's my best friend,' Callie said. 'She always has been. 'And I can honestly say that.' Paula said she and her daughter have been incredibly open about the truth and how she isn't Callie's biological mother. 'I've always taught her from day one they are her parents,' Paula said. 'She was born in Whitney's belly and she was born in my heart'. It is Paula's journey through the ordeal that was arguably the most turbulent. She found out the truth first after her boyfriend asked for a paternity test to see if he were Callie's father. The test was negative for both him and her. Neither of the them were Callie's biological parent. She then reported it to the Virginia hospital, who pieced together what had happened. Struggle: After finding out the truth, Paula Johnson (left) began a long and arduous custody battle to claim her biological daughter, Rebecca Chittum, following the death of Rebecca's parents . Paula Johnson (left), holding a picture of the daughter she thought was hers, Callie, in 1998 . Cute as a button: This is a family photo of Callie Marie Johnson . The hospital pored over records. Only one baby girl born in the same short window as Callie that July had the right blood type. The Chittum and Rogers family found out the truth two weeks after Kevin and Whitney's funeral following a blood test of Rebecca. Paula even remembered bumping into Whitney in the hall when both were in labor. After learning that Kevin and Whitney died, Paula tried to claim her biological child and sued for custody of Rebecca in 1999. However Kevin and Whitney's parents, the grandparents as Rebecca knew them, fought just as hard to keep her. Following a bitter three-year battle both in and out of court, a judge ruled the girls would stay with the families who had raised until they were old enough to make their own decisions. A visitation schedule was put into play, but both girls quickly grew tired of the long trips to see biological family members they hardly knew. Paula also sued the University of Virginia Center for their mistake, hoping for a damages payout of $31 million. Happy family: Paula Johnson and daughter Callie share a giggle inside Callie's home in Richmond, Virginia . Not-so-happy: Paula Johnson says she has never been able to let go of the hate she feels from her ordeal and the fact she has no relationship with her biological daughter . However she settled for just $1.25 million. Paula said her anger at the situation has never really subsided. 'I’m angry because I don’t have a relationship with my biological child,' she said this week. 'I’m angry that Kevin and Whitney aren’t here to see what a beautiful child she is and how much she’s grown. 'I’m angry at the hospital because the only thing I ever asked was them to apologize.'

Duckworth gave birth to Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey on Tuesday and the lawmaker's office made the announcement yesterday. Abigail is Duckworth's first child. The birth came a few weeks before her due date of December 5. Good news: Iraq veteran and Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, pictured left, and right with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey, has given birth to her first child, a girl she has named Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey . In a statement reported by the Chicago-Tribune Duckworth said: 'My husband Bryan and I are thrilled to announce that we are the proud parents of a baby girl. 'Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey was born on Nov. 18. Bryan and I were deeply honored that Senator Akaka acted as Hawaiian elder and selected her middle name.' Daniel Akaka, a Democrat, served as a senator from Hawaii until 2013. Duckworth met her husband Bryan Bowlsbey at George Washington University and married him in 1993. He is a Major in the National Guard. The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, was born in Thailand and spent part of her youth in Hawaii where she graduated from McKinley High School. Service: Duckworth is pictured serving with the Illinois Army National Guard during her tour of duty in Iraq. In 2004, she lost both legs when the helicopter she was in was shot down on a mission near Baghdad . Fighter: She is pictured wearing her Purple Heart medal at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2004 . Her mother is Thai and her late father was American. Duckworth announced her pregnancy on NBC's 'Today' show in September saying she and her husband, a major with the National Guard Bureau, had used assisted reproductive technology in order for her to conceive. The newborn's earlier-than-expected arrival caps off a successful month. She was a second term in congress on November 12. In October it was announced that Duckworth, a lieutenant colonel in the Illinois Army National Guard, was retiring from the military. Duckworth was flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq on November 12, 2004 when she was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, losing both of her legs and shattering her right arm. After returning to the U.S. and learning how to walk with the help of prosthetics, she worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs between 2006 and 2009. She was elected to Congress in 2012. Band of mothers: Duckworth, middle, on the Today show with fellow veteran amputees, Melissa Stockwell, left, who is also expecting a baby, and Dawn Halfaker, right, who gave birth four months ago . Duckworth is the first disabled female veteran and the first female Asian American from Illinois to serve in the House. She is also one of five female veterans who lost limbs in Iraq and, coincidentally, four of them are pregnant or recently gave birth. Melissa Stockwell, who lost most of her left leg from a roadside bomb in 2004 before going on to compete in the 2008 Paralympics, also appeared on the show. Her son is due in November. 'Tammy and I as being lower limb amputees I think very initially wondered if it would be possible to have children and learned pretty quickly you can still have children and provide, but I think you have to find yourself first,' Stockwell said. They appeared on the show beside Dawn Halfaker, who lost an arm in Iraq, and who is now mother to a four-month-old boy. Then finally, Danielle Green-Byrd, who lost an arm during combat in 2004 before helping vets with PTSD, gave birth to a son 10 days ago. 'These women were there for me as the band of sisters when I went through the greatest pain, the greatest trauma in my life,' Duckworth said. 'And now we get to be together for the time of greatest joy.'", "reference": "Tammy Duckworth gave birth to Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey .\nShe and her husband Bryan were 'trilled' to make the announcement .\nDuckworth lost both of her legs after her helicopter was shot down in Iraq ."}

A gunman shot the 23-year-old assistant photographer twice near the heart with a shotgun in the lobby of the newspaper's offices in Paris. Liberation Publisher Nicolas Demorand told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Monday that the victim was \"a little better\" Tuesday but still in critical condition. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins earlier said he was in intensive care. The gunman fled after the attack, and authorities released photos showing a 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8 man with a \"European appearance\" and graying hair. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old. Police said he was carrying one or two bags and was wearing a khaki parka or a green pullover, a dark sleeveless vest, green-and-white basketball shoes and a dark cap. On Tuesday, police released another image of the suspect that showed him wearing what appeared to be a red parka, blue T-shirt and pale brown knitted hat. Paris police had no information about the man's motive, and prosecutors issued a plea for witnesses who may have seen a man \"making death threats while carrying a gun,\" according to a statement. The suspect apparently also opened fire in front of Societe Generale towers in Paris, the international bank said on Twitter. There were no injuries in that shooting, and police are investigating, the bank said. Another man told police he was carjacked in the neighborhood of La Defense. The bank's towers are in the same neighborhood. The man said he dropped the assailant off near the Champs-Elysee, the city's main street, according to police. On Friday, a gunman broke into BFMTV, threatening journalists before fleeing. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. But it has not been established that it was the same man.", "reference": "A gunman shot a photographer at the Paris offices of Liberation newspaper Monday .\nThe photographer was hit twice near the heart and is said to be in a critical condition .\nFrench police hunting the suspect issued a second image of him Tuesday .\nPolice are also investigating a carjacking, shots outside a bank and a gun threat at TV offices ."}

This month he was welcomed on board one of the world's most revered cruise liners Queen Mary 2 in New York as a one of the most celebrated headliners to ever perform in the ship's Royal Court Theatre. The 16-time Grammy Award-winning musician honoured the community in which he was raised by performing songs from his musical The Last Ship, which arrived in New York last week from a debut run in Chicago. Returning to his roots: Wallsend boy Sting is honouring his youth growing up near the shipyards . Songs of the seas: The musician performed numbers from his musical The Last Ship on board Queen Mary 2 . 'I was born and raised in Wallsend in the shadow of the Swan Hunter shipyard,' the 63-year-old said. 'My earliest memories are of ships being built and launched into the river. 'You couldn’t escape Swan Hunter – there was a coal mine at one end of town and Swan Hunter at the other, so these ships loomed over our houses. 'With The Last Ship, I thought I would try and honour the community that I came from. Because everyone around me worked in the shipyard. My grandfather worked in the shipyard. All his brothers worked in the shipyard. My family has had things to do with the sea for many years.'

At 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) asteroid 2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth at a distance 3.1 times greater than that of the moon - far too distant to be of any threat. Observers on Earth were able to view the asteroid with binoculars or a telescope  -and Nasa's high powered telescopes revealed it had its own moon. Scroll down for video . The 20 individual images used in the movie were generated from data collected at Goldstone on Jan. 26, 2015. They show the primary body is approximately 1,100 feet (325 meters) across and has a small moon approximately 230 feet (70 meters) across. The images show the asteroid, which made its closest approach today (Jan. 26, 2015) at 8:19 a.m. PST (11:19 a.m. EST) at a distance of about 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers, or 3.1 times the distance from Earth to the moon), has its own small moon. The 20 individual images used in the movie were generated from data collected at Goldstone on Jan. 26, 2015. They show the primary body is approximately 1,100 feet (325 meters) across and has a small moon approximately 230 feet (70 meters) across. In the near-Earth population, about 16 percent of asteroids that are about 655 feet (200 meters) or larger are a binary (the primary asteroid with a smaller asteroid moon orbiting it) or even triple systems (two moons). Asteroid 2004 BL86 was initially discovered on 30 January 2004 by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (Linear) survey in White Sands, New Mexico. Astronomers had thought the asteroid was about 1,640ft (500 metres) wide, but new images have revealed it to be smaller at about 980ft (300 metres) across. But, even passing at a distance of 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers), Nasa said the asteroid posed absolutely no threat to Earth. This was the closest pass of an asteroid this large until 2027 when another - (137108) 1999 AN10 - passes our planet within one lunar distance. The asteroid will be at its closest point to Earth at 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) today. However, observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa will have the best chance to view it when it is fully illuminated by the sun and at its brightest, at 1.00am GMT tomorrow (8.00pm EST today). During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer, and should be visible just above Jupiter. It will then skim the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about 5am GMT tomorrow (midnight EST tonight). The asteroid will continue to be visible until tomorrow night, giving astronomers a rare opportunity to study an object of this type and size. 'The asteroid's close pass will enable ground based radio astronomers to bounce radio waves off the object, to get a much better determination of its overall shape and true size,' astronomer Nick Howes, who works with the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, told MailOnline. 'This data, combined with that from many ground based visual observations will give us more insights into these near-Earth objects, and hopefully play a part in mitigating the risk of any future ones possibly hitting Earth.' Dr Don Yeomans, who is retiring as manager of Nasa's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, after 16 years in the position, added: 'Monday, January 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to Earth for at least the next 200 years. 'And while it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' 2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth at 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST). The asteroid passed about 3.1 times the distance of Earth to the moon (illustrated). It is estimated that the asteroid is 980ft (300 metres) in size. Novice stargazers should be able to view it with binoculars or a telescope through today and tomorrow . In a live Slooh webcast, images of the asteroid from Mauna Kea in Hawaii (shown) were also shown. Over the next day it is expected that more images of the asteroid will be returned, revealing new details . One way Nasa scientists plan to learn more about 2004 BL86 is to observe it with microwaves. Nasa's Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to Earth. 'When we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer Dr Lance Benner of JPL, the principal investigator for the Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'At present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' At the time of its closest approach on 26 January, the asteroid was approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth - and it is now moving away from our planet . This image shows the asteroid moving through the night sky on 23 January. The asteroid has a tail in the image due to its fast speed. Astronomers will be hoping for even better views later today . Where to watch: Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing the asteroid. It will begin to be visible in the night sky from about 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) today, but will be at its brightest at 1.00am GMT tomorrow (8.00pm EST today) when it is fully illuminated by the sun . Almost exactly when it becomes brightest (about 9th magnitude), asteroid 2004 BL86 skirts very close to the Beehive Cluster, M44. During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It will later skim the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) The asteroid orbits the Sun every 1.84 years. It was discovered 11 years ago by the Linear telescope in New Mexico, which was designed to hunt for such objects. Despite the asteroid's two close visits then and now, it won't approach Earth again this closely for another 200 years. Astronomers have also assigned this asteroid a permanent number, 357439, but it has not yet been named. Because it's relatively large, 2004 BL86 will brighten rapidly as it approaches and passes Earth. The asteroid will brighten, despite the increasing distance, because we're seeing its face become more fully illuminated. 'One good technique for [finding] fast-movers like 2004 BL86 is to identify and lock onto a star along its path,' explains Kelly Beatty from Sky and Telescope. 'Then just watch at the time that the asteroid is predicted to pass by that particular star.' The asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said Dr Yeomans. 'Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'", "reference": "2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth at 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) today .\nIt will remain visible with binoculars or a telescope until tomorrow .\nThe asteroid passed about 3.1 times the distance of Earth to the moon .\nNew images suggest the asteroid is 980ft (300 metres) in size .\nAstronomers will be hoping to study it as it passes Earth .\nBut novice stargazers can also view it near Jupiter with binoculars .\nObservers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats .\nIt will appear to move backwards in the night sky relative to other stars .\nThis will be the closest approach of an asteroid this size until 2027 .\nNasa says it poses no threat to Earth 'for the foreseeable future'"}

Mr Peston used the term on his blog to describe the European financial crisis. He also posted a link to the blog on his Twitter account, where he has 95,000 followers. In praising the UK's handling of the situation, he wrote: 'The Debt Management Office, has taken a reassuringly long-term approach to managing the UK government's debts - and without its prudence, we might all be in Queer Street or Skid Row by now.' However, Mr Peston was criticised soon after as people accused him of homophobia over the use of the word 'queer', which has long been used as an insult against the gay community. One tweet from follower Peter Scott, said: 'Tsk tsk Mr P, not quite homophobic but a bit homo-frowny'. Two hours later Mr Peston was moved to comment on the row and dispatched another tweet. It read: 'Some of you seem to think my use of the phrase \"Queer Street\" is in some way homophobic. Bonkers.' The tweet included a link to the Wikipedia page detailing the origin of the term Queer Street. While Peston was criticisied in some quarters, he has been robustly defended in others. The offending phrase: The term 'Queer Street' was used in the final paragraph of his original blog post . Hitting back: Mr Peston's response to the accusations of homophobia . One of his followers, Joan Wilson, lamented the Twitter criticism: 'If there were more reflection and less reaction, this country wouldn't be in this state.' But Mr Peston, who is married to novelist Sian Busby, was also defended by the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. He said the row was an over-reaction because the BBC reporter had not meant the word to be derogatory. 'People are being oversensitive, I appreciate their good intentions but he wasn’t using it in a gay put-down sense,' he told The Telegraph, . 'The etymology of the word \"queer\" as Robert Peston used it has nothing to do with homosexuality.' While the origins of the term are debated, 'Queer Street' is generally associated with a place of financial difficulty . One of the various explanations of its etymology is that it is a distortion of Carey Street in London, which was once associated with debtors' courts.", "reference": "'Some of you seem to think my use of the phrase \"Queer Street\" is in some way homophobic.

Huge 250 metre high ice channels have been found beneath the Antarctic which could be speeding up melting of the ice shelf. The channels are almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower and are thought to stretch hundreds of kilometres along the ice shelf. Scientists believe they have implications for ice-shelf stability around them but added that the long-term implications for the ice sheet are still unknown. Huge 250 metre high ice channels have been found beneath the Antarctic which could be speeding up melting of the ice shelf. The finding was made using the British Antarctic Survey's Twin Otter survey plane (pictured) which collected data about the size of the sub-ice-shelf channel . The British researchers used satellite images and airborne radar measurements to reveal the channels under the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. The channels can be seen on the surface of the ice shelf, as well as underneath, because the ice floats at a different height depending on its thickness. 'The biggest challenge was the lack of field data that is available to investigate the nature of the channels, we can observe them from above in the satellite imagery, but have little direct observations from radar,' Dr Anne Le Brocq from the University of Exeter, told MailOnline. Using what data they had, the researchers were able to predict the path of meltwater flowing under parts of the ice which were in contact with the land. The ice shelf channel is clearly visible on the MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica image map. The predicted flow route of water beneath the grounded ice sheet aligns with the initiation of the ice shelf channel. The dashed line marks the point at which the ice starts to float . They discovered that these channels . lined up with areas where similar flows of water are thought to exist . under the ice shelf at the point where the ice starts to float. According to the researchers, the match-up indicates that the water flow beneath the grounded ice sheet is responsible for the formation of the channels beneath the floating ice shelf. 'It was a bit of a “Eureka moment” when I found the predicted water flow routes lined up with the channels,' said Dr Le Brocq. 'They provide us with a very useful way of investigating an otherwise fairly inaccessible environment.' When the meltwater flowing under the ice sheet enters the ocean beneath, it causes a plume of ocean water to form, which then melts out the vast channels under the ice shelf. Previously, it was thought that water flowed in a thin layer beneath the ice sheet, but the evidence from this study suggests it flows in a more focused manner, much like rivers. The way in which water flows beneath the ice sheet strongly influences the speed of ice flow. Schematic diagram shows the approximate scale of one of the ice shelf channels, similar in height to the Eiffel Tower, and Tower Bridge in width. Scientists believe the channels are weakening areas of ice immediately around them . Vast channels such as this have been . observed elsewhere, but their formation has been credited to purely . oceanic processes rather than meltwater flowing out of the grounded ice . sheet. 'Unlike in Greenland where meltwater is produced at the surface, this meltwater is generated beneath the ice sheet so there isn’t a direct link to climate change,' said Dr Le Brocq. 'However, in order to make predictions about how the ice sheet will respond to environmental change in the future, we need to understand the mechanisms by which ice flows and how it interacts with the ocean.' Dr Le Brocq said she now hopes to carry out more field investigations into the channels using radar measurements, and will further investigate the formation of the plumes using a computer model. The project, which was reported in the . journal Nature GeoScience, involved the University of Exeter, Newcastle . University, the University of Bristol, the University of Edinburgh, the .

The wife of injured England physio Gary Lewin has today blamed his broken ankle on Brazilian groundsmen who watered astroturf in front of the dugout. Maggie Lewin, 51, said her husband was 'disappointed' to fly home from the World Cup early after he was injured celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal against Italy in Manaus on Saturday night. England’s own physio had jumped in delight only to dislocate his ankle and also break his tibia and fracture his fibia, Mrs Lewin said.

{"id": 15297, "article": "A doctor at a government-run Ebola treatment center in Monrovia is too busy to mince words. \"You have so many patients in agony. Patients are crying in pain,\" said Soka Moses. \"They are dying and all you do is you watch them die sometimes. You pray for them and do the little you do, and just hope that something miraculous happens,\" he said. Moses got just one day's training before jumping in to treat high-risk Ebola patients, which he says is typical. You simply do what needs to be done here, he said. At his center, one patient is too weak to hold up his own head. He writhes in pain as he's given water to drink. Another is laid on the floor because there is no place else to put him. There are two patients for every bed. \"Life is rough, and then you die. What else can we do? If we don't do it, who will do it for us?\" asked Moses. \"We have to take the risk and cater to the patients, or else our country will be wiped away.\" 'The poor are left to die' West Africa is in the midst of the worst Ebola outbreak in history. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some 9,000 people have contracted the disease so far. Heath officials put the death toll at around 4,500, meaning that one in two people who get Ebola in this outbreak die. The odds are not good. They are especially not good for patients who are poor and live in places with underfunded and mismanaged health systems -- countries like Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have been hardest hit. Although much has been made of the cases in Spain and the United States, nearly all of the people getting sick from Ebola are in West Africa. \"The rich get the best care. The poor are left to die,\" the World Health Organization said last month. The outbreak highlights the dangers of growing social and economic equality, said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. It also lays bare the risks of a purely profit-driven system. Chan made the point that Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago, but there are still no vaccines and no cure. She wondered why. \"Answer: because Ebola has been, historically, geographically confined to poor African nations. \"The R&D incentive is virtually nonexistent. A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay,\" the WHO said. WHO to review Ebola response amid criticism . 'Stop it at its source' There are signs, however, that attitudes are changing. A deadly virus anywhere is a threat to everywhere now. \"We can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa where this disease is raging. Our medical experts tell us that the best way to stop this disease is to stop it at its source, before it spreads even wider and becomes even more difficult to contain,\" President Barack Obama said recently. \"If we want to protect Americans from Ebola here at home, we have to end it over there,\" he said. To that point, here's a look at what's happening in West Africa: . Liberia . The WHO says the outbreak in Liberia is by far the most worrisome. Approximately 2,500 people have died there, according to health officials, but that figure is almost certainly higher. Some families are reportedly hiding deaths to circumvent the government's mandatory cremation policy. \"The true number of deaths will likely never be known, as bodies in the notoriously poor, filthy and overcrowded West Point slum, in the capital, Monrovia, have simply been thrown into the two nearby rivers,\" the WHO said last month. According to the organization, new cases are increasing exponentially and there are many more patients than beds. Further complicating efforts there, health workers have threatened to strike over pay and unsafe working conditions. \"I don't want to strike, but the President (of Liberia) has to listen,\" said Moses, the doctor. \"You don't want to have angry people knocking at your doors during this kind of emergency situation, so the President has to listen and act very fast.\" Sierra Leone . In terms of sheer numbers, Sierra Leone is second hardest-hit by the Ebola outbreak. Close to 1,200 people have died there. Among the dead are doctors and nurses, which slows down the country's capacity to respond. Every district is affected, according to Doctors Without Borders, or MSF. The government has put five districts under quarantine, preventing people from leaving the area, the humanitarian organization said. MSF also said it was seeing more orphaned children in its centers and a lack of caregivers. Guinea . The first case in this deadly outbreak has been identified by the WHO as a 2-year-old boy in the Guinean village of Meliandou. He fell ill and died in December. The area in southern Guinea is close to the Sierra Leone and Liberia borders, and the disease spread quickly. In total, more than 800 people have died there during the outbreak. \"On at least three occasions, prospects for nationwide control looked good and the countdown for a case-free 21-day incubation period began,\" said WHO. \"The country never made it. As the deadline approached, cases suddenly flared up again in previously controlled villages and cities. In other instances, the virus marched on to infect previously untouched areas,\" it said last month. Nigeria and Senegal . The experiences of Nigeria and Senegal offer a rare bright spot in this outbreak. International MSF teams left Nigeria on October 5. If there are no new cases reported there by Monday, the outbreak will be declared officially over there. The virus was introduced in Nigeria by an air traveler, who arrived in Lagos in July. WHO credits an aggressive government response and effective contact tracing for keeping the virus in check. Ebola claimed just eight lives in Nigeria. Meanwhile in Senegal, there was just one confirmed case of Ebola, and that patient made a full recovery. WHO declared the country free of the disease last week.", "reference": "Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have been hardest hit .\nOne in two people who get Ebola in this outbreak die .\nThe experiences of Nigeria, Senegal offer a rare bright spot ."}
{"id": 15298, "article": "A primary school teacher who tried to have sex with a 10 year old student and had his name tattooed on her chest in an infinity symbol has escaped jail time. Diane Brimble, 47, appeared at the County Court of Victoria on Thursday and was handed a two year correction order. Judge Mark Taft sentenced Brimble to 200 hours of community service and ordered her to be placed on the sex offender register for eight years. The mother of eight was convicted by a jury in August of a single charge of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex in 2013. Diane Brimble was sentenced to 200 hours of community service after she was convicted of a single charge of committing an indecent act on . She was acquitted of five other charges and will never teach again. In handing down his judgement, the Judge Taft said he was at a complete loss to understand why Brimble would carry out such conduct but noted she was unlikely to reoffend. Judge Taft also made reference to a letter Brimble wrote to her victim in which she said 'I love you more than you ever know' and 'there will never be anyone else in my heart'. The full note read: 'I miss you more than words can say. I can't write how much I miss you because there just aren't enough words. 'I love you more than you will ever know. There will never be anyone else in my heart. Though you will be so far away when I leave I will still see you every night in my dreams just as I do now. 'Infinite love, forever in my heart. Always and forever.' Judge Taft said: 'It beggars belief that a mature teacher should write such a letter to her student.' The mother of eight, 47, grabbed the 10-year-old victim while he was in her home and asked him to sleep with her . She was acquitted of five other charges and will never teach again . 'I reject suggestion that inexperience as a new teacher and naivety explain your behaviour,' he told the court. Judge Taft also said: 'You breached the trust reposed in you by (the boy's) parents who properly expected that a classroom teacher would care for their son in a professional manner.' 'Your offending occurred in a context of obsessive and entirely misdirected affection for (the boy) which you described as \"love\".' The court heard the offence occurred in 2013 when Brimble was the child's teacher and lived next door to the 10 year old's family. The boy had been at a friends house with Brimble's own family when she drove him and her children back to her home. 'In the hallway, you grabbed (the boy), hugged him, asked him if he would sleep with you that night and have sex,' Judge Taft told the court. '(The boy) asked you why he would sleep with you and you told him that you loved him. He pushed your hands away and you kissed him on the cheek. I miss you more than words can say. I can't write how much I miss you because there just aren't enough words. I love you more than you will ever know. There will never be anyone else in my heart. Though you will be so far away when I leave I will still see you every night in my dreams just as I do now. Infinite love, forever in my heart. Always and forever. 'He told you that he was not old enough to have sex and you said 'You are when you're at my house'. The boy's mother had earlier told the court Brimble turned her son into a 'sexual commodity'. She had lured the boy to her rose-covered home in Hamilton in country Victoria for sex, the court heard. Just two years after graduating from university to take her 'dream come true' job teaching primary schoolkids, 47-year-old Brimble was exposing her breasts to the boy, asking him for sex and showing him condoms and sex toys. She had a framed photo of the boy on her bedside table and designed a tattoo with the words 'love for' and his name in an infinity symbol. The boy's mother told the court they had to move from their community and the boy was placed on antipsychotic medication. The boy's mother had earlier told the court Brimble turned her son into a 'sexual commodity' Brimble had the boy's name tattooed on her chest in an infinity symbol, like the one above . She said it also impacted on his siblings. 'They drew pictures of rainbows and unicorns. He drew black pictures of knives and death,' she said, reading her victim impact statement to the court. The father said the boy would not look at his parents as he believed Brimble had cast a spell on him, so she could see and hear everything he did. The father's victim impact statement was read to the court by prosecutor Patrick Bourke, who said Brimble tried to tour the boy's new school and enrol her children there. He said his son, who has Asperger's syndrome, said Brimble was 'on him'. 'She tried to manipulate [him] to make him think she loved him and his parents did not,' the statement read out by prosecutor Patrick Bourke said. 'I feel sick every time I think of my son's name tattooed on her body.' Brimble faced court in August charged with five counts of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years, and one charge of using a telecommunications device to groom a child. She pleaded not guilty to all six charges. Brimble was convicted by a jury in August of a single charge of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex in 2013 . The boy Brimble approached  had to be placed on antipsychotic medication after the event in November 2013 . A jury took two days to find her not guilty of the child grooming charge and four other charges, but convicted her of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex. Before she fell in love with the 10-year-old boy, tattooed his name on her chest and made him believe she had cast a spell on him, Brimble had once been described as a selfless 'supermum'. During the trial at Warrnambool County Court – just minutes from the university campus where she had so proudly graduated in 2011 – Brimble was described as exhibiting 'bizarre' conduct and a baffling 'psycho sexual profile'. Barrister Jennifer Clark, on behalf of Brimble, said her client had developed an affection beyond the normal teacher/student relationship, 'but she has not overstepped into criminal conduct'. Ms Clark said Brimble had endured a difficult life and an abusive marriage which she had fought hard to overcome by becoming a teacher.

'It's still very difficult for me to talk about,' Solo said in the GMA interview. 'I'm not going to go into all the details. 'I was a victim of domestic violence, at the hands of my 17-year-old nephew, who is 6 foot 9 inches and 280 pounds. 'He struck me over the head and I was concussed pretty severely. 'It was a very scary night.' Solo's nephew and her half-sister were not charged in the fight, and they still maintain Solo was the aggressor. U.S. Soccer did not suspend her after the incident, however they did following the controversial traffic stop with her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens. In January the two were driving in southern California -  where Colo was in a training camp - when Stevans was pulled over in a U.S. soccer van and arrested on suspicion of drink driving. Solo was said to have become 'belligerent' with police during the stop and was almost arrested for disorderly conduct. U.S. Soccer subsequently suspended her for 30-days, which threw into doubt her chances to play in next month's Alagrve Cup in Portugal. However Solo was reinstated last week.

Troubled: Solo was suspended  after her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, was arrested in Southern California on suspicion of driving under the influence in a U.S. team van . Solo thanked U.S. Soccer for reinstating her and seeing her through the controversy. 'All of us, in my opinion, have a fundamental right to be considered innocent until proven guilty,' she said. 'I know U.S. Soccer took a lot of heat. 'But I am very grateful that they let due process play itself out. 'Those eight months were some of the worst months of my entire life.' U.S. women's national team coach Jill Ellis announced Solo's inclusion on the Algarve Cup 25-player travel roster on Saturday. The United States, playing in its 20th Algarve Cup, opens with Norway. Solo has posted inspirational messages from fans on social media during her absence, and cheered on the national team in exhibition games in Europe. The United States fell 2-0 against France before beating England 1-0 with goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris starting in both games. Solo's suspension came at a critical time for the U.S. team, which is preparing for the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada. 'The situation warranted a consequence, and we thought it was reasonable,' Ellis said about Solo before the team traveled to Europe. 'This is important for us to be able to focus the players that we have on these games and then allow Hope some time to sort of reflect on some things.' The goalkeeper was dismissed in January from training camp in Southern California, where the team was preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June . Hope Solo was in the car when her husband Jerramy Stevens, pictured together in 2013, was arrested for drunk driving last month . It was the latest off-field trouble for the 33-year-old Olympian, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the women's game. Earlier this year, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her. Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California . Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial. Her last appearance in a match with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. In a statement released following her suspension, Solo said: 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.' A representative for Solo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Algarve roster also includes Christine Rampone (back), Megan Rapinoe (right knee), who were injured during the team's January training camp in Carson, California, and did not play the two matches in Europe.

The 43-year-old driver has had a disappointing start to the year despite his Mercedes team's promising pace in qualifying and pre-race practice sessions. He was forced to pull out of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in March after suffering a gearbox failure, then finished 10th in Malaysia. The German, who has struggled since coming back from retirement in 2010, finished eighth in China last year. \"As for the race itself, I've never had much luck in Shanghai, apart from my win in 2006,\" he told reporters in Shanghai. \"In the first two races of 2012 we didn't manage to maintain our qualifying pace in race conditions. We've been working intensively on this, so that we can offer our fans a strong performance in China.\" The former Ferrari star is now determined to secure a win in front of his huge following in Asia. \"When I think about the Chinese Grand Prix, the fans are the first thing that comes to mind.

Devotees of paper and ink have long argued that ebook readers are missing out. And soon they might be proved right – as books sold in good old-fashioned bookshops begin promising more material. Extra chapters will appear in copies bought from high street retailers that will be absent from ebooks or printed copies sold by online stores such as Amazon. Secret weapon: Joanne Harris fans who buy their copy of her latest book from Waterstone's will find it includes an extra chapter not available anywhere else . The move is an attempt to end the dominance of the internet retailers – and bring shoppers back to the high street. Fans of Chocolat author Joanne Harris who buy her follow-up novel, Peaches For Monsieur Le Curé, from Waterstone's will find it includes an extra chapter not available to those who snap up their copy at a reduced rate from Amazon or other web retailers. The book chain signed an exclusive deal with the popular writer in the hope it will encourage readers to turn their backs on internet stores and e-books and return to browsing the shelves at high street bookshops. The chapter is not essential to the plot of Peaches For Monsieur Le Curé, but can be read either as an epilogue or the 'prologue to an as-yet-unwritten story', the author has said. Bonus material: Author Joanne Harris, left, has penned an extra chapter of her latest book (right) exclusively available to readers who buy their copy from Waterstone's . Internet giant Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year, racking up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter. It put the surge in sales down to boost from Kindle e-book sales, which were up a staggering 70 per cent. Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year in a clear indication of the continued mass migration of shoppers from the high street to the web. The web giant racked up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from £10bn in the same period of the previous year. Kindle e-book sales -up a whopping 70 per cent - were credited for the surge in profits. Overall sales were up by 22 per cent, driven by the popularity of the Kindle Fire. 'After five years, electronic books is a multibillion dollar category for us and growing fast,' Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time. The figures are in stark contrast to the picture on the high street, which is home to less than half the number of bookshops today as seven years ago due to book lovers deserting physical stores in favour of downloading e-books for Kindles and other tablets, or of ordering cut-price copies over the internet. That supermarket shoppers can add a bestselling paperback to their trolley for as little as £4 in Tesco or Asda has also contributed to the demise of the high street bookshop, where the same copy might cost twice as much. The partnership between Harris and Waterstone's is among a number of novel tactics being employed by traditional booksellers as they attempt to preserve their place on the beleagured British high street. Alexander McCall Smith, author of the smash hit No1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, recently teamed up with Foyles to produce an extra short story to accompany copies of his novel Trains And Lovers on sale in its stores, while acclaimed author Ian Rankin has also penned bookshop-only bonus material. Waterstone's also previously offered a limited edition of Claire Tomlinson's biography of Charles Dickens which included a map of London and other extra material. Fight back: Alexander McCall Smith wrote an extra short story for fans who buy his book Trains And Lovers from Foyles . Tom Tivnan, features editor at book industry magazine The Bookseller, said it was essential for bookshops to seek new and innovative ways of ensuring their survival. 'They have to work out what things they can do that online retailers can't,' he told the Independent, citing membership clubs, coffee shops, and creches as means of luring bookworms away from the internet and back into stores. 'Physical bookshops have to survive,' said Mr Tivnan. 'Authors and publishers really want to keep bookshops and libraries open.' Competition: More readers are choosing to download e-books, left, rather than buy copies from bookshops . Despite the backing of top authors . the traditional bookshop still has its work cut out when it comes to . winning back customers. The number of bookshops in the country now stands at less than 2,000. Seven years ago the figure was double that. The bookworms' mecca of Hay-on-Wye, home to one of the world's biggest literary festivals, has lost five of its 30 independent bookshops from 2011. The blow led to local booksellers including Derek Addyman, who runs three second-hand bookshops in the Welsh border town, to call for Kindles to be banned from last summer's festival.

{"id": 15302, "article": "(CNN) -- The promoter and agent who first brought The Beatles to America has died. Sid Bernstein died Wednesday in New York City, publicist Merle Frimark said in a statement. He was 95. Bernstein helped start the \"British invasion\" by bringing The Beatles to Carnegie Hall and later, to New York's Shea Stadium for landmark concerts in 1965 and 1966. People we've lost in 2013 . Bernstein booked the Carnegie Hall concert in August 1963 -- the same year that Capitol Records had rejected three singles from the group. \"I'm a hunch player, you see,\" Bernstein once said, according to his publicist's statement. \"I was just glad to get this group I had been reading about for months. It took eight months after I booked them for there to be any airplay of their records on the radio. I had to convince Carnegie Hall and my financial backers to take a chance on this then-unknown group. I had been reading about their progress in the European papers and was fascinated with the hysteria that surrounded them. I was the first to promote The Beatles in the States and Ed Sullivan called me first about them before he ever booked them on his television show.\" The Beatles in color - Unseen photos . Ultimately, it was Sullivan's audience who heard them first, on February 9, 1964. The Carnegie Hall concert that Bernstein booked was three days later.

{"id": 15303, "article": "(CNN) -- It's just days till Christmas, and many young girls around the world will be thrilled to find little dolls under the tree to play with. But there's new evidence that it's not only human girls who enjoy playing with imaginary babies -- young apes may be showing the same behavior. A research paper published Tuesday has found what its authors say is the first-ever evidence that young female chimpanzees in the wild \"play\" with sticks as if they are dolls. \"We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play,\" they write in the current issue of Current Biology. \"And, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males.\" The team of researchers watched and logged the Kanyawara group of chimpanzees in the Kibale National Park in Uganda for more than a decade. They were surprised to see young female chimpanzees carrying around sticks, apparently mimicking the way that mothers in the group cared for their own infants. The behavior would go on for up to hours at a time. \"The juveniles carried pieces of bark, small logs or woody vine, with their hand or mouth, underarm or, most commonly, tucked between the abdomen and thigh,\" they wrote. \"Individuals carried sticks for periods of one minute to more than four hours during which they rested, walked, climbed, slept and fed as usual.\" Co-authors Sonya Kahlenberg of Bates College and Richard Wrangham of Harvard University found that such behavior was witnessed only rarely among young male chimpanzees, pointing to the controversial idea that differences in play behavior even in other primate species may be gender-driven. Boy chimpanzees typically used sticks as weapons, shaking them to intimidate playmates. But just like human boys with \"action figures,\" young male chimpanzees were sometimes seen playing with dolls as well. Kahlenberg described one 4-year-old male named Kakama in an e-mail response: . \"He was observed to bring his stick into his nest and play the 'airplane game' with it, that is, he laid on his back with his arms and legs extended upward and balanced the stick on his upturned palms and 'flew' it from side to side. This behavior is performed by mother chimpanzees with their infants and, of course, human parents do it as well. Another interesting observation is that Kakama even constructed a separate nest for his stick.\" It could be some combination of nature and nurture, as monkeys and apes have been observed playing with toys and dolls in captivity before, with previous studies showing an affinity for females to take on mothering role-play. \"Sex differences in juvenile stick-carrying did not result from females observing their mothers carrying sticks, since mothers never carried sticks,\" the study found. \"Instead, youngsters apparently learned socially from each other. Such juvenile traditions have previously been described only in humans.\" So should this behavior in any way alter the way we perceive chimpanzees, and any affiliation with human behaviors? \"Regarding how this study is related to the sex difference that we see in how human children play, it has at the very least contributed to the discussion of the factors underlying these differences,\" Kahlenberg answered. \"Our results suggest that part of the explanation may lie in innate differences between males and females. Specifically, there may be differences in how the sexes play that shape how they interact with toys, including which types they prefer.\" That finding would suggest there may be a genetic and gender-driven force behind the play. The behavior seemed to be a practice exercise for how to care for babies, with the chimpanzees often seen taking the sticks back to their nests and playing with them in the same way mothers did with real offspring. The authors say that the doll play may have evolved to help the animals learn how to be better mothers and caretakers.", "reference": "Report in Current Biology: Behavior is more common in females than in males .\nYoung chimps carried sticks in a manner similar to mothers caring for their young .\nBoy chimps typically used sticks as weapons, but sometimes showed doll-play behavior .\nResearch paper was based on more than a decade observing chimps in Uganda ."}
{"id": 15304, "article": "Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to reveal whether she voted for President Barack Obama, dodging the question for the second time in a week Monday during the only debate of Kentucky's Senate race. Grimes, the Democratic secretary of state who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in one of the nation's marquee races, cited the \"matter of principle\" of privacy at the ballot box, noting that she is the state's chief election officer. \"I'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or (an)other side or members of the media,\" she said during Monday night's debate. The answer echoed one she gave the Louisville Courier-Journal's editorial board last week, which touched off days of criticism -- with NBC \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd saying that Grimes \"disqualified herself,\" and McConnell's campaign immediately placing that comment in a new ad. It came after McConnell had already blasted Grimes for trying to hide her political allegiances in a state where Obama is deeply unpopular. \"My opponent has spent spent most of her time trying to deceive everybody about her own views,\" the five-term Republican said. McConnell also criticized Grimes' answer on whether she voted for Obama, saying there is \"no sacred right to not announce how we vote.\" He offered that he had \"proudly\" voted for GOP nominees John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, and said he voted for Trey Grayson during Kentucky's 2010 primary against now-Sen. Rand Paul. McConnell also said he doesn't buy Grimes' claim that she is a \"Clinton Democrat.\" \"There's not a dime's worth of difference between a Clinton Democrat and an Obama Democrat,\" he said. The debate was the only chance Kentucky voters will have to see the two candidates grapple personally in what's been one of the nation's most expensive races, and one of about a dozen that are key to Republicans' chances of seizing at least six more seats and taking control of the Senate. The free-wheeling, hour-long event was almost entirely negative -- with Grimes calling McConnell \"Senator Gridlock, Senator No-show or Senator Shutdown,\" painting him as an obstructionist and accusing him of doing the bidding of conservative political funding giants Charles and David Koch. She referred to the Koch brothers as McConnell's \"family,\" and later, his \"henchmen.\" Much of the debate was focused on coal, with Grimes criticizing the Obama administration's move to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants by 30% over the next 25 years and McConnell going even harder after the Environmental Protection Agency and saying Grimes would be a reliable Obama supporter on issues like energy. \"It's pretty obvious, given where all her support comes from, all the anti-coal activists in the country, that she's going to do their bidding,\" he said. The two also tangled over Grimes' push to increase the minimum wage and equal pay legislation, and Grimes landed a shot against McConnell for putting \"two wars on a nation's credit card.\" Grimes benefited late in the debate from a series of questions on Obamacare that demonstrated the difficulties GOP candidates face in states that have already expanded access to coverage under the 2010 health care law. Kentucky's Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, accepted the federal Medicaid expansion and set up a state-run insurance exchange called Kynect. McConnell said he wants to repeal the health care law \"root and branch\" and that hospitals \"are being rim-racked by these Medicare reimbursement reductions.\" But he wouldn't address the future of Kynect, saying that \"it's a state decision\" and that \"it's fine to have a website.\" Grimes said McConnell is living in a \"fictional fantasyland\" on the issue and that more than 500,000 Kentucky residents now have health insurance because of the law. \"I will not be the senator that rips that insurance from their hands,\" she said. Several times Grimes said McConnell had already had 30 years to carry his policy ideas through. But McConnell shot back that he was the one who negotiated several bipartisan efforts to extend the debt ceiling and stave off government shutdowns with Vice President Joe Biden in recent years. And he argued that a possible future role would position him to advance Kentucky's interests. \"There's a great likelihood,\" McConnell said, \"that I will be the leader of the majority in the Senate next year.\"", "reference": "Kentucky's Democratic Senate candidate won't say if she voted for President Obama .\nAlison Lundergan Grimes cited the \"matter of principle\" of privacy at the ballot box .\nGOP Sen.

Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland, California. Officer John Hege, 41, was pronounced brain dead on Sunday but was kept on life support pending a decision on organ donation. He was the fourth Oakland officer to die after a gunman fired on police in two weekend incidents. \"Officer Hege was registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Registry, which his family also supports,\" the donor network said in a news release. \"He chose in death as he did in life to help those in need. His organ donations saved the lives of four adult males from California.\" Hege's liver, kidneys and heart were donated, the network said, and the transplants were successfully completed Tuesday and early Wednesday. In a written statement, Hege's family said, \"Our son John never met a stranger.\" \"John's courage and strength was enhanced by his ability to perceive the realities of life,\" the family said in the statement. \"In June 2008, he registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry.

The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding, police said. Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon. The incidents began about 1 p.m. Saturday in east Oakland, when two motorcycle officers tried to pull over a car for a \"fairly routine traffic stop,\" said Dave Kozicki, deputy police chief. Emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot and needed help, he said. Those officers were Hege and Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, an 18-year veteran of the force. Dunakin died Saturday. Police launched an intense manhunt to track down the gunman. An anonymous caller directed authorities to a building on an adjacent street where the man was believed to be barricaded, acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said. The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man, Jordan said. Those two officers -- Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35 -- died. Police said Romans had been with the department since 1996 and Sakai since 2000.

{"id": 15307, "article": "In 2001 a huge earthquake shook the state of Gujarat in India. 2,000 people were killed, 400,000 lost their homes, and countless more lost their businesses in the devastation. One young entrepreneur, Mansukhbhai Prajapati, lost everything, but found an innovative way to get back on his feet. Prajapati designed a low-cost clay fridge which required no electricity and continued to function in the event of major catastrophes or blackouts such as the one that devastated his village. Prajapati's invention is part of a growing trend in India that has become known as \"frugal innovation\" -- below-the-radar inventors across the country devising low-cost solutions to local problems, often borne of necessity, using bespoke technologies of their own creation. So striking has the trend for frugal innovation become, that last year the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta), an independent charity in the UK, commissioned and published a major research paper on the phenomenon. The paper said \"frugal innovation is found throughout the Indian system: from ... efforts to crowdsource drug discovery driven by government labs, to Bharti Airtel's approach to cutting the cost of mobile phone calls, to the Keralan approach to palliative care which is providing access to support at the end of life for thousands in a void of formal healthcare.\" At the forefront of the frugal innovation movement is Professor Anil Gupta who, for the last 20 years, has been travelling across India in search of local inventors whose creativity has had a positive impact on rural poverty. In 1989, Gupta founded the Honey Bee Network, an organization that uncovers grassroots inventors, and helps bring their inventions to the world. \"I have walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years,\" says Gupta. \"I have tried to map the minds of people who are creating around the country.\" Gupta's journey has brought him into contact with inventors who are solving common problems in frugal ways, using traditional knowledge and readily available materials. By his own reckoning, Gupta believes that the Honey Bee Network has helped unearth over 25,000 new inventions, including a motorbike-mounted crop sprayer, a device for climbing trees, an amphibious bicycle and a wind-powered irrigation system. Kirsten Bound, the author of Nesta's report, says \"frugal innovation is all about creating advantage out of constraint. Faced with scarce resources and institutional voids, frugal innovators develop radical new solutions to problems. It's not just about making things cheaper, but better, more appropriate and scalable. It involves leveraging available resources in new ways, reducing or re-using waste or even re-thinking an entire system around a product or service.\" Mansukhbhai Patel, a Gujerati farmer devised just such a product. Picking cotton in Gujarat is a manual task which, in the past, has frequently been undertaken by children. In a bid to reduce the work involved, Patel invented a cotton-stripping machine that can be operated by one person. Professor Gupta believes the invention has helped significantly reduce child labor in the region. Frugal Digital, a research group run by the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, seeks to promote exactly this kind of invention. The group runs projects in conjunction with Indian inventors to build cheap, \"hackable\" devices to solve enduring problems across the subcontinent. Priya Mani, project manager for Frugal Digital, says that there is a lot to learn from \"thinking about how you can hack everyday castaway objects.\" The projects the organization has run in conjunction with Indian inventors have already yielded products that are being used around India today, including a classroom projector fashioned from repurposed cell phone components and a low-cost health screening tool made from an old alarm clock. But Mani believes that work being done by frugal innovators  in India has yet to have a significant international impact: \"People thought we were totally nuts trying to create something new out of old parts.\" Bound believes that the philosophy of frugal innovation and the practice of repurposing technology  could be applied globally. \"Frugal innovation coming out of India could have important implications for the rest of the world\" says Bound. \"General Electric has shown with its now famous ultra-low cost ECG machine that there is a Western market for products born out of the constraints of the Indian healthcare market. It forces multinationals to think about how their existing investment intensive models of innovation can face inevitable growing competition with Indian and Chinese multinationals.\" Of course, not all stories of frugal innovation have a happy ending. In 1975, flooding across India brought the province of Bihar to a standstill. The rising waters in the village of Jatwa-Janerwa made it impossible for many people to work, shop or go about their daily lives. Local honey salesman, Mohammed Saidullah, was forced to cross the swollen Ganges river for sell honey, but every trip came at a price -- the boat was expensive and paying the levy was driving him towards penury -- so he came up with novel solution. Saidullah locked himself away for three days of solid design and construction. When he emerged he had constructed an amphibious bicycle, which would allow him to contend with the annual monsoon. It looked like a regular bike, but had large retractable floats attached to the sides of each wheel. Saidullah's invention earned him a raft of awards including the National Innovation Foundation's lifetime achievement award. Yet in spite of the recognition, the inventor still lives in poverty. Gupta says there is work to be done yet in connecting creative people with funding, and not all of it can come from the public purse. According to Gupta, connecting grassroots technologists with big business will be key to development not just in India, but around the world. \"Nothing,\" he says, \"can justify preventing people from learning from one another.\"", "reference": "Indian inventors recycle old technology to solve local problems .\nInventions include amphibious bicycles, wind-powered irrigation systems and tree-climbing machines .\nFrugal innovators around India have patented their inventions and received awards ."}
{"id": 15308, "article": "The Metropolitan Police will pay more than £400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child by an undercover officer, it was claimed today. The woman, known only as Jacqui, has a son with Bob Lambert, who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) which placed officers in deep-cover roles between 1968 and 2008. She was one of several women taking High Court action against the Met over the actions of officers like Lambert, whom she knew as ‘Bob Robinson’ when a young activist in the 1980s. Undercover officer: The woman has a son with Bob Lambert (above), who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad . Jacqui is reportedly to receive £425,000 and in an interview with the Guardian and the BBC, she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children. She said: ‘The legal case is finished but there is no closure for me. There is the money, but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong, there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers.’ ‘I don't know why I was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with Bob Lambert. ‘I don't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour I went through giving birth to our son. I feel violated.’ In August four former SDS officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences. The Met was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘neither confirm nor deny’ (NCND) in response to the damages claims. Known as 'Bob Robinson': The woman said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of Bob Lambert's real identity as a police officer who was married with children . Scotland Yard: The woman was one of several women taking High Court action against the Metropolitan Police over the actions of officers like Lambert . As a result, the force confirmed Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers. Request: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured), the Met commissioner, has been told by the woman's lawyer that he should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships . Jules Carey, Jacqui's lawyer, told the Guardian and BBC that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships. Mr Carey told them: ‘The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself. ‘It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice’. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force ‘unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with Bob Lambert, an undercover officer, has had on this woman’ but said that it had ‘never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing’. He said: ‘We recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son. From the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity, completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances. We regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress. ‘We want to be, and have tried hard to be, as open as we possibly can. Arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing, but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic.' Fathering a child while working undercover proved no barrier to Bob Lambert’s successful 30-year career with the Met Police. In fact, after five years spent infiltrating Left-wing groups in the 1980s he was promoted to oversee more junior members of the notorious Special Demonstration Squad. Over the next two decades he became an expert in combating Islamic and Right-wing extremism. He was even awarded an MBE in 2008 for ‘services to police work’ after retiring into academia. When Jacqui, the mother of Lambert’s child, recognised him in a report on the undercover policing scandal, she managed to track him down to St Andrews University. He was reunited with his son, now in his 20s, and Jacqui learned Lambert’s other two children had died from a genetic heart defect – which thankfully, their son does not share. Fighting back tears yesterday, Jacqui said she has become friends with Lambert and his second wife. Describing their first conversation on the phone, she said: ‘I had not spoken to him since he walked out on me but I instantly knew it was him.’ Lambert now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at St Andrews and is a part-time senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University. He was also co-director of the European Muslim Research Centre at Exeter University for several years. He is soon to publish a book on Anders Breivik, who killed more than 70 people in Norway in 2011.", "reference": "'Jacqui' has son with Special Demonstration Squad member Bob Lambert .\nNow-defunct SDS placed officers in deep-cover roles from 1968 to 2008 .\nSeveral women taking court action against Met over actions of officers .\nShe knew him as 'Bob Robinson' when a young activist in the 1980s ."}

Malian and French forces have together been battling the Islamists to loosen their grip on the country's north, which the militants have controlled for months. Hollande, who refused to speculate on how long the French intervention would continue, said the Islamists still control the northern part of the country. The United States has also stepped up its involvement in the conflict by conducting aerial refueling missions on top of the intelligence and airlift support it was already providing.

Malian and French soldiers scored a key victory last week, taking control of Gao, a city east of Timbuktu that for months had been a militant stronghold. And flushing the Islamists out of Timbuktu, Mali's historic cultural center, would be a big symbolic gain. The Islamists were reported to be fleeing Timbuktu to the city of Kidal, more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) to the northeast. New fears for Timbuktu in Mali conflict . The quickening advance of the government forces has brought them to the heart of the territory held by the militants. Covering the fighting up close is almost impossible for journalists, who are prevented from gaining access to the front line. Journalists are allowed to enter a town only after it has been freed and its security guaranteed by French and Malian troops. French forces are involved in the fight in Mali, a former French colony that retains close ties with Paris, in an effort to prevent the Islamists from turning the once peaceful democracy into a haven for international terrorists. France has 2,150 soldiers on Malian soil, with 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. Photos: Fears for Timbuktu in Mali conflict . The Islamic extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. Refugees have told harrowing stories of life under the Islamist militants. But human rights groups have also raised concerns about reports that Malian soldiers are themselves carrying out extrajudicial killings and abuses as they counterstrike.

The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court issued a statement Monday putting Malian forces on notice that \"all those alleged to be responsible for serious crimes in Mali must be held accountable.\" \"My Office is aware of reports that Malian forces may have committed abuses in recent days, in central Mali,\" the prosecutor said. \"I urge the Malian authorities to put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses and on the basis of the principle of complementarity, to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the alleged crimes.\" The restrictions on journalists make it harder to gauge the realities on the ground. The United Nations' refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called for an increase in international aid for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced by the fighting in the country. More than 150,000 refugees have fled Mali into neighboring countries, and another 230,000 are displaced inside Mali, the agency said. One casualty in the battle for Timbuktu is the city's library, which was designated a world heritage site because of a treasure of rare books and manuscripts about precolonial Africa, a South Africa professor told CNN on Monday. \"What we don't know is the full extent of the damage,\" said Shamil Jeppie, who is director of the Timbuktu Manuscripts project. \"There are no phones or communications to Timbuktu, and there haven't been for some time. Much of the images show documents and papers tossed on the ground, but it appears that just a portion of the library is actually burned. The building itself was certainly razed.\" Jeppie said it would \"be a loss for all humanity if the manuscripts were destroyed.\" \"In a continent in which most of the memory of peoples is transferred orally through storytelling and can be lost, the people in Timbuktu had a written tradition that is quite rare in Africa,\" he said. \"Most books that we get our knowledge of precolonial Africa were written by missionaries and seen through their eyes. This history is deeply precolonial, and we still have much to learn and simply can't do it without the documentation that is only there in Timbuktu.\" CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.", "reference": "\"We are winning in Mali,\" French president says .\nFrench forces are fighting the remaining Islamists in Timbuktu .\nMilitants are reported to be fleeing to another city farther northeast .\nMalian and French forces recaptured an Islamist stronghold last week ."}

The war between Apple and Samsung shows no sign of abating, as the release date of iPhone 5 rumbles ever closer (albeit without confirmation from Apple itself) - and many of Samsung's products remain paralysed in legal limbo by Apple lawsuits. Now it seems Samsung is going to strike back. 'We'll be pursuing our rights for this in a more aggressive way from now on,' Lee Younghee, head of global marketing for the company's mobile division said this week. Younghee also said that Apple was 'free riding' on Samsung wireless technologies - lending credibility to rumours that Samsung would attempt to torpedo iPhone 5 before its European launch. Too similar? Samsung's Galaxy touchscreens and iPhone are currently the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries . Ever since Apple launched its iPhone, . it's been an open secret that Samsung makes many of the components . inside it - in fact Samsung's CEO has admitted, 'Apple is our biggest . customer.' But ever since Samsung launched its . own Galaxy series of phones and tablets - high-powered touchscreens . whose flagship, the Galaxy S II, currently outpaces iPhone on the . processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine . countries. A Samsung executive told the Korea . Times this week, 'When the iPhone 5 arrives here, Samsung plans to take Apple to . court here for its violation of Samsung's wireless technology related . patents.' This is in . response to Apple's continued legal action against Samsung's Galaxy . family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are . currently illegal in Europe, thanks to Apple lawsuits claiming they are 'slavish' copies of iPhone and iPad. Samsung recently overtook Nokia in . the smartphone market, and its Galaxy S II offers a larger screen and . faster processor than iPhone 4 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs. This month, Apple even forced Samsung to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a Berlin electronics show. Samsung's larger Galaxy 10.1 tablet remains illegal in Europe thanks to Apple's legal action. The Maeil Business Newspaper reported that the South Korean firm may seek an injunction against Apple's new iPhone in Europe. Samsung said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues. Legal battle rages between Apple and Samsung over alleged 'similarities between their touchscreen smartphones and handsets . The two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as Google and Microsoft.

After Apple's latest legal victory in Germany earlier this month, Samsung said it would take all available legal options.

{"id": 15311, "article": "By . Alan Roden . Scottish soldiers will desert Alex Salmond’s independent army to fight alongside their British comrades if the SNP wins next year’s referendum. A devastating new study which quizzed servicemen has left the Nationalists’ defence blueprint in tatters, concluding that Mr Salmond’s proposals ‘do not withstand serious scrutiny’. For the first time, serving soldiers were asked for their views and ‘a majority – perhaps even a large majority’ would prefer to remain with the British Armed Forces’ because they will see action instead of spending their time in Scotland 'thumb twiddling’. Scroll down for video . Desertion: Troops in Scottish regiments will reject Alex Salmond's independent army, a new report reveals, raising doubts about the future of regiments like the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders pictured on a parade through Port Glasgow Town last month . In one platoon, 30 of the 32 men who returned from Afghanistan earlier this year said they would not join a Scottish defence force (SDF). One soldier was undecided and another admitted he would join the SDF for an easier life, adding: ‘All we’d be doing is checking passports on the M6.’ One officer questioned why a young Scottish man would sign up to ‘sit on the border in Cyprus or Lebanon with a blue beret and no rounds in his rifle’ when he could instead train at Sandhurst and join an elite fighting force. The findings have raised fears of a ‘two-tier’ military structure in Scotland, with the brightest and best youngsters choosing to defend Britain before transferring to the SDF once they are married, have children and want to ‘calm down a bit later in life’. Scotland would also need its own special forces to protect the North Sea oil rigs, but there would be a major recruitment crisis because the job would involve ‘thumb twiddling’. Other findings in the 128-page report from the highly respected Henry Jackson Society include: . The report, launched in Edinburgh today, has been written by defence expert and author George Grant. He has previously provided briefings to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Latest figures show that Scotland’s notional share of the UK’s defence budget was nearly £3.3billion in 2011-12. The SNP has drawn up plans to spend £2.5billion on a 15,000-strong Scottish military if there is a ‘yes’ vote in next year’s referendum, although it claims this is around £500million more than is currently spent within Scotland’s borders. Check point: The report is a devastating blow to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who yesterday launched the official 2014 Ryder Cup Tartan at Lochcarron of Scotland mill in Selkirk, Borders with tournament director Richard Hills . Mr Grant’s report concludes that ‘if one is being objective on this subject, it is almost impossible not to arrive at the conclusion that – as things currently stand – defence policy is one of the SNP’s weak points’. ‘This is not because they have attempted to put forward a fully thought-through defence strategy that nevertheless appears to have some deficiencies, but rather because their strategy appears to be predicated more on how not to alienate voters, than on how to actually defend Scotland.’ He adds: ‘It is the considered conclusion of this report that not only have the SNP failed to answer most questions adequately to date, but that any – if not the majority – of their proposals for defence do not withstand serious scrutiny.’ The SNP wants to keep all of Scotland’s historic Army regiments, but that would require around 14,000 personnel – leaving just 1,000 for an air force and a navy. And one of the major problems would be persuading Scots soldiers to desert the British Armed Forces. One officer told the report’s author: ‘What of the young officer born, raised, and educated in Scotland? He can either join the Paras [British Army Parachute Regiment] or the local Scots regiment. ‘If he chooses the latter, he cannot go to Sandhurst; so he would be going to a new training school in Scotland, with the best hope of going and sitting on the border in Cyprus or Lebanon with a blue beret and no rounds in his rifle. ‘Or he can join the Paras, one of the most recognisable regiments in the world. What’s he going to do? It’s a no brainer; the SDF would be too dead-end and too parochial.’ The officer said the SDF would be staffed by ‘second-class Scots soldiers’. Elite: Scottish troops would prefer to train at Sandhurst in Berkshire (pictured) before fighting on the frontline around the world, instead of joining peacekeeping operations with a Scottish force . Defence experts Professor Sir Hew Strachan told Mr Grant: ‘I can envisage a two-tier military service, where ambitious young Scots join the British Army, and then, once he’s married and got children and wants to calm down a bit later in life, he transfers to the Scottish Army.’ The report outlines potential massive job losses in the shipyards and at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, where the UK’s Trident nuclear missile system is based. But it also warns of the impact on defence companies. ‘Privately, concerns have been raised about the potential loss of access to the world’s second-largest defence market, and there have been some discussions about the possibility of relocation south of the border in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote in 2014,’ it claims. Criticism: Labour's shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said the SNP's plans are NP defence plans are 'quarter-baked' ‘One well-placed source told this report . that, following discussions he had had with the board of one of the big . defence companies, ‘they said quite clearly that, if Scotland became . independent, they would move their operation out from near Edinburgh’. The company in question employs several thousand people in Scotland who, . the source said, would consequently lose their jobs.’ Addressing military infrastructure, the study found that the Eurofighter Typhoon would likely be too ‘expensive and complex’ for a separate Scotland, while the ageing Tornado GR4 ‘lacks an air-to-air capability’ and the Hawk trainer is ‘comparatively slow, with no radar and only limited offensive capability’. ‘Therefore, it would be unable to fulfil the air-defence function envisaged by the party,’ the report states. The study also suggests that purchasing four diesel-powered submarines would cost Scotland up to £2.6billion, which is described as ‘prohibitive’. Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘It’s official. The SNP defence plans are quarter-baked. ‘There’s a growing army of experts who have shown just how flawed their defence plans are. The defence and security of Scotland’s people and national interests must be the top priority, but all we get from the SNP is political posturing.’ But a spokesman for the Scottish Government said an independent Scotland would have ‘first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and cooperating with international partners’. ‘Scotland stands to inherit a fair share of existing UK defence assets, and an annual defence and security budget of £2.5billion would represent an increase of more than £500million on recent UK levels of defence spending in Scotland,’ he said. ‘We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane - which will be Scotland’s main conventional naval facility – and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases.’", "reference": "Damning report reveals reluctance of soldiers to join Alex Salmond's army .\nOfficers dismiss Scottish Defence Force as 'too dead-end and parochial'\nTroops would rather stay in British forces so they can see action .\nThe SNP’s defence strategy is not geared towards defending Scotland, but is designed ‘to help it win the independence referendum’.\nA separate Scotland would have an ‘Army-centric’ military, when a greater focus on maritime and air defence ‘would be preferable’.\nDefence firms that employ thousands of Scots could be forced to relocate to England to access the world’s second-largest defence market.\nOrders for the UK’s Type 26 global combat ship would ‘almost certainly’ be lost, and – in time – ‘most’ of Scotland’s shipyards would close.\nSNP plans to base Scotland’s navy on the Clyde raise ‘legitimate questions’, given that oil and gas rigs are located almost entirely in the north and east."}

Actress Naomi Watts shocked the world when she announced the late Princess Diana had given her 'permission' to play her on screen. But she is not the only one who believes the tragic royal is communicating with them from beyond the grave. Ken and Jo Dobson, who describe themselves as 'Britain's biggest Diana fanatics', claim to have experienced 'unmistakable' signals from the former Princess of Wales - and even believe they have seen her spirit. Scroll down for video . Dedicated: Jo and Ken Dobson say Princess Diana interacts with them from beyond the grave . Fan: Jo and Ken have met, among others, Diana's brother Earl Spencer and former butler Paul Burrell . The Gloucestershire pair, who first developed a fascination with the People's Princess when she entered public life with her engagement to Prince Charles in 1981, have amassed collectibles worth thousands of pounds and have dedicated their lives to preserving her memory. Jo, 74, said: 'We've loved Diana from day one.There was something about that young lady that just drew you to her. We can't explain it - we just loved her.' But it wasn't until after her untimely death in Paris in 1997 that they decided to formalise their devotion by co-founding the 'Diana Circle UK'. 'There are seven of us all together and we started this two years after Diana died,' said Jo. 'We were all standing outside Kensington Palace and we said \"this woman must never be forgotten - we must keep her memory alive\".' Every inch of their modest bungalow is now dedicated to Diana and they have so many photographs, sketches, plates and dolls that they are considering getting planning permission for an extension - or even erecting a tent in their garden. Collection: Jo and Ken have amassed memorabilia worth many thousands of pounds over the last 30 years . Shrine: The couple are convinced Diana was murdered and was 'like a lamb to the slaughter' They believe the huge collection could be worth a five-figure sum but say they would never sell any of the memorabilia. 'We're not worried about the money in this, we just buy, buy, buy,' said Ken, 76. The couple say they are also in contact with Diana's former butler Paul Burrell and speak to him 'once a week'. They constantly study the circumstances of her death and have no doubt she was murdered. 'She was a like a lamb to the slaughter,' said Ken, who recently lost his sight and believes Diana helped him through his stay in hospital. 'We don't think the truth will come out in our time - but it will in years to come.' Like Diana, who was once friends with TV medium Psychic Sally, Ken and Jo are spiritualists and say they have forged a bond with Diana. Spooky: According to Jo, Diana's face briefly appeared on a Christmas fairy one year before fading away . Memory: The pair co-founded the Diana Circle UK and hope to keep memories of the late princess alive . According to the couple, signs . include white feathers that have mysteriously fallen from the sky and a . special Diana candle which went out as her body was taken back to her . childhood home of Althorp in Northamptionshire. They . also have a rose bush in their back garden, which they say develops red . blotches around the day of Diana's death, which they call 'blood . spots'. However, the strongest signal to date came at Christmas one year, recalls Jo. 'I'll never forget it,' she said. 'We were at my sister's one year and she always had a big Christmas tree for her grandchildren. I just happened to glance up and instead of the fairy on top of the tree there was Diana's face - and she was just looking down smiling. 'Then she gradually faded away until she was gone. We are not spooky or anything but we believe it. We don't care what other people say.' Disapproval: The Dobsons have said that they are not impressed by the new biopic of Princess Diana . Despite their determination to keep Diana's memory alive, they are horrified by the release of the new film, Diana, which hit cinemas earlier this month. Jo, who says the only royals she has time for are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, said: 'We've got no time for this Diana film. I think in a way it's disgusting they've done this because 16 years on and that young girl could not be laid to rest. 'It's ruining Diana's reputation, that poor girl. She's done a lot for this country.'

{"id": 15313, "article": "The national civil-rights group American Atheists has launched a new billboard campaign in Salt Lake City with a play on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints’ (LDS) ‘I’m a Mormon’ campaign, to promote its upcoming national convention. The billboard features a native Utah family and reads: ‘We’re the Monnett family, and We’re Atheists,’ with the words ‘Mormons’ and ‘ex-Mormons’ crossed out. The board, placed in the Mormon heartland, encourages people to ‘Come explore your doubt with us’. The American Atheists strongly believe that ex-Mormons should not continue to base their identity in Mormonism . American Atheists President David Silverman said: ‘Many atheists still call themselves Mormons or ex-Mormons. Our message is this: If you don’t believe anymore, don’t continue to base your identity in Mormonism. ‘You’re so much more than an “ex-Mormon”; you’re an atheist! And you are very far from alone. Be proud to be an atheist - we are, and we want to celebrate being an atheist with you. He added: ‘American Atheists is reaching out to people who are on a journey away from indoctrination, even if they’re not ready to be open about that. Strong views: The previous American Atheists billboard was harder hitting . The American Atheist billboard is based on the 'I'm a mormon' ad campaign . ‘Countless Utahns are already free from religion but remain “in the closet” about their beliefs. They are surrounded by religion and as a result, feel like they are alone. ‘The National Convention will fix that by creating a fun and entertaining atmosphere where atheists from all over the country will meet, learn, and laugh. We invite everyone - especially those who have doubts about their religion -to join us.’ In designing the ad, American Atheists sought a genuine Utah atheist family to appear on the billboard. Overwhelmed with responses, the group chose the Monnetts of South Jordan. West Monnett, a sports coach and stay-at-home dad, and his wife, Lennie, a director in finance, are both atheists who used to identify as ex-Mormons. Their children, Bentley and Tallen, as well as their niece, McKayla (of whom West and Lennie are guardians), are also featured on the billboard. McKayla’s mother, Melinda Dayley, has accused some atheist groups of needlessly attacking religious organisations and is not entirely supportive of her daughter appearing on the billboard. She told The Salt Lake Tribune that she’s ‘not very happy’ about McKayla’s inclusion and added: ‘I have friends that are atheists … but they’re not out there knocking our beliefs. West is the type that has to go out and prove a point. He’s always been that kind of person.’ However, the latest billboard is considered to be less incendiary than its predecessor, which read ‘God Is A Space Alien. Baptizes Dead People. Big Money, Big Bigotry’. The 2014 National Convention will feature speakers including NFL star Chris Kluwe, Survivor: Philippines winner Denise Stapley, and Grammy-nominated Spin Doctors bass player Mark White, all atheists themselves, but none of whom have ever before spoken for an atheist audience. Other speakers include Reverend Barry Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, Maryam Namazie of the Council of ex-Muslims, popular bloggers PZ Myers and Greta Christina, and American Atheists President David Silverman.

The new Hollywood movie, Carrie, which is the third silver-screened adaption of King’s horror story, was released on Friday, October 18, starring Julianne Moore and Chloë Grace Moretz. But 40 years ago, when King wrote the first three pages of Carrie in 1973, he immediately crumpled them up and threw them in the dustbin. Scroll down for video... Believed in him: Stephen King, right, says his wife Tabby, left, saved Carrie from the dustbin. Carrie launched his career as a best-selling author . Discarded: The horror story, Carrie, by Stephen King, almost did not make it past three pages . He was disappointed in himself and felt he couldn’t write from a woman’s perspective, according to Mental Floss. The whole story disgusted him, too. Carrie White, the main character, was an annoying, ready-made victim and he felt the plot was already moving too slowly. ‘I couldn’t see wasting two weeks, maybe even a month, creating a novella I didn’t like and wouldn’t be able to sell,’ King wrote in his memoir, On Writing. ‘So I threw it away … After all, who wanted to read a book about a poor girl with menstrual problems?’ The next day, his wife Tabby found the . three crinkled balls of paper and when King came home from work, she . told him, ‘You’ve got something here. I really think you do'. First attempt: In the early 70s King felt Carrie White, the main character, was an annoying, ready-made victim when he first wrote the book . Over the next few weeks, Tabby guided . her husband through the world of women, giving tips on how to mold the . characters and the famous shower scene. Nine months later the final draft was finished. This . was at a time when King was a poor man. He and Tabby lived in a trailer . and drove a rusty Buick held together by baling wire and duct tape. Tabby . worked second-shift at Dunkin’ Donuts while King taught English at . Hampden Academy, a private high school in eastern Maine. To scrape by, King worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant. Barely scraping by: King worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant while he was writing Carrie in the early 70s . He modelled the character of Carrie on two of the loneliest girls he remembered from high school. One was a timid epileptic with a voice that always gurgled with phlegm. Her fundamentalist mother kept a life-size crucifix in the living room, and it was clear to King that the thought of it followed her down the halls. The second girl was a loner who wore the same outfit every day, which drew cruel taunts. By the time King wrote Carrie, both of those girls were dead. The first died alone after a seizure. The second suffered from postpartum depression and, one day, aimed a rifle at her stomach and pulled the trigger. The final draft was turned down for 30 publishers, but one, the editor at Doubleday Publishing, Bill Thompson, offered him a $2,500 advance to publish the book. Instant: Stephen King was catapulted to fame with the book Carrie in 1973 and has written many books since . King used the advance to buy a shiny Ford Pinto and moved his family out of the trailer and into a dumpy four-room apartment in Bangor, Maine. They suddenly had money for groceries and could even afford a telephone. He hoped that fat royalty checks would keep replenishing his bank account, but Carrie only sold 13,000 copies as a hardback, which convinced him to grudgingly sign a new teaching contract for the 1974 school year. But soon after, one phone call changed everything. It was Bill Thompson again. ‘Are you sitting down?’ he asked. King was home alone, standing in the doorway between his kitchen and living room. ‘Do I need to? he said. ‘You might,’ Thompson said. ‘The paperback rights to Carrie went to Signet Books for $400,000 ... 200K of it is yours. Congratulations, Stephen.’ Break-through: The paperback rights to Carrie were given to Signet Books for $400,000 in 1973 at a time when King was a poor teacher with almost no money . Successful: King is now the 19th best-selling author of all time . Carrie sold over 1 million copies in its first year as a paperback despite a mixed critical response. The New York Times was impressed, considering it was a first novel, while Library Journal called it ‘terribly overdone.’ Falling somewhere in the middle, the critic at the Wilson Library Journal said, ‘It’s pure trash, but I loved it.’ The book-buying public was more enthusiastic - Carrie was a hit. The novel struck a sympathetic chord with teens and adults who knew what it was like to be an outsider. In 1975, it was adapted into a profitable feature film, which sparked a sequel a decade later. The second version: Actress Emily Bergl in the 1998 film adaption of Carrie . New version: The new film adaption of Carrie, starring Chloë Grace Moretz, pictured, was released on October 18 .

He talked about the woman who rescued Carrie from the trash and insisted he keep going - Tabby. ‘If my wife had suggested to me even with love and kindness and gentleness ... that the time had come to put my dreams away and support my family, I would have done that with no complaint,’ said King at the awards ceremony.

{"id": 15315, "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With \"birthers\" mostly silent, \"deathers\" are now pushing a new conspiracy theory. The release of President Obama's birth certificate last week apparently tamped down -- to a large degree -- skeptics who questioned whether he could legally serve as president because they said he wasn't a natural-born citizen. Now, a surprisingly diverse crop of people are questioning whether Osama bin Laden is actually dead. Some media outlets and bloggers are calling them \"deathers.\" Their claims follow a wide range: Some believe that the world's most-wanted terrorist was not the man killed Sunday, others think bin Laden is dead but was killed many years ago, and still others believe that the September 11 mastermind is alive -- and secretly being interrogated. One Fox Business Network host is not going quite that far. Judge Andrew Napolitano at one point declared that \"Osama bin Laden is dead,\" but he later seemed unconvinced. Napolitano also questioned the president's authority to kill him. Napolitano began his Monday show by saying bin Laden was \"killed on the illegal whim of the president.\" Moments later, he added, \"Osama bin Laden is dead. And the president seems to think he has the right to kill whomever he wants so long as the person is perceived as a monster and the public supports it.\" And yet the judge also questioned whether officials are \"telling us the truth or pulling a fast one to save Obama's lousy presidency.\" Later in the broadcast, Napolitano asked a guest, \"Do you believe he's dead, or do you want some more evidence: a photograph, a testimony of an eyewitness? Something other than the words of a president whose words we have doubted before?\" Others who are questioning bin Laden's death include a libertarian talk radio host, a well-known liberal anti-war activist and some everyday Pakistani students. What their claims all have in common -- much like claims that the president was born outside the U.S., instead of in Hawaii -- is that they go against the agreed-upon facts. Poll: 3% now think Obama born abroad . Obama's decision not to release the photos of bin Laden's death seems to be stoking \"deather\" fires. Alex Jones is a Texas-based talk radio host who also runs various websites and whose YouTube channel claims more than 24 million views. He is sometimes called a right-wing conspiracy theorist. After the president's announcement of bin Laden's death, Jones told his listeners in one broadcast, \"My friends, this is a complete and total hoax.\" \"Where is the body?\" Jones asked in another show. \"My White House sources nine years ago, on record, confirmed that he had been killed and was frozen on ice.\" Opinion: A no-win decision on releasing photos . Cindy Sheehan, who is certainly not an ideological ally of Jones', appears to agree with him on bin Laden's death. Sheehan became famous for protesting President George W. Bush's Iraq policy -- even camping out at the White House and the president's Crawford, Texas, ranch -- after her son was killed in the war. Shortly after the president's bin Laden announcement, Sheehan planted seeds of doubt on her Facebook page and blog. \"It's not that I don't believe Obama about Osama because he's Obama, I don't believe him because he is just one in along line of butt-naked emperors,\" Sheehan wrote. \"The only proof of Osama being dead again that we were offered was Obama telling us that there was a DNA match between the man killed by the Navy SEALs and OBL. Even if it is possible to get DNA done so quickly, and the regime did have bin Laden DNA lying around a lab somewhere -- where is the empirical proof?\" Sheehan continued. Meanwhile, a Facebook page -- named \"Osama Bin Laden Not Dead\" -- has been created as a sort of message board for theories. \"This whole story is a distraction from Obama's birth certificate bollox,\" Kevin Lane posted. \"That was all over the news until in the space of 24 hours he had found OBL, killed (but not captured) him, done DNA tests and got the results (dont that take 3 days) and dumped his body at sea. Surely if OBL was/is such a bad man they would want the world to see him dead whether the pics are gruesome or not.\" \"Bin Laden was taken alive and is being interrogated some where before being executed,\" David Colin Leach posted. Shortly after the announcement of bin Laden's death, university students in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he was killed, expressed skepticism. \"That's propaganda,\" one student told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. \"Osama has been killed 10 years ago in Afghanistan. And it's just a propaganda to finish the war in Afghanistan.\" Others refused to believe that bin Laden was even in Abbottabad. And others echoed calls for the Obama administration to show pictures. \"If it is true, then why are they not showing his body?\" one student asked. Would image silence doubters or fan flames?

Sir Bobby Robson was something to everyone; the grandfather of the game, a father figure to his players and the son of a proud North East region. His death was mourned but his life celebrated, every tear dried with a smile. Five years on, his legacy is tangible in the form of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, the brilliant charity which has raised £7.3million for cancer research, treatment and care. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tributes to Sir Bobby Robson . Missed: It has been five years since the passing of Sir Bobby Robson . Gone, but never forgotten: Thursday marks the anniversary of Sir Bobby's passing at the age of 76 . Tribute: Ipswich Town's Portman Road stadium is adorned with the face of former manager Robson . Thursday marks the anniversary of his passing at the age of 76 and the Football Association will honour the former England manager - and 20-times capped wing-half - with a Sir Bobby Robson Day celebration. His popularity, however, is everlasting, the memories make sure of that. Italia 90, of course, came some years before his success at PSV Eindhoven, Sporting Lisbon, FC Porto, Barcelona and Newcastle United, but it is the image of Robson dancing on the touchline in the wake of David Platt’s winning goal against Belgium which remains his most overriding; bronzed skin, silver hair, gold standard. England’s joyous journey to the semi-final in Italy triggered the explosion of football’s popularity and its appeal to a new generation, not, as many would have you believe, the birth of the Premier League. Special: Robson cared, not only about his players, but every supporter who walked through the turnstile . Former Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper took to Twitter to pay tribute to his former boss, writing: '5yrs ago today we lost not only a great manager but a great man too. His tremendous legacy lives on through the fantastic @SBRFoundation' Prior to this summer’s World Cup, a television feature asked England’s players for their Three Lions hero – to a man they replied ‘Paul Gascoigne’, the star of 1990. Gascoigne, however, attributes everything to Robson. ‘He was like a second dad, a phenomenal human being,’ he once said. The affection was mutual. The Sir Bobby Robson Trophy Match at St James’ Park recreated the semi-final between England and West Germany and came just five days before Robson’s death. Frail and in a wheelchair, It was his final appearance in public. Until the end, however, his first thought was football and the players he had nurtured. On his way home from the game he asked, ‘How was Gascoigne? How did Gascoigne do?’. Honoured: The Sir Bobby Robson statue stands proudly outside Newcastle United's stadium . Robson cared. Another Gascoigne anecdote springs to mind. The night before that semi-final against the Germans, Robson’s star midfielder was missing. The manager tracked him down to a tennis court where he was taking on two American tourists. Rather than turn on Gascoigne, Robson asked the unsuspecting Americans why they were expending his player’s energy the night before the biggest game of his life. Gascoigne took advantage and headed straight for bed. Twenty-four hours later and Robson was again looking out for his prodigious talent following the booking which would rule him out of the final. Gary Lineker, famously, turned to Robson in the wake of Gascoigne’s tears. Lineker later said: ‘Out of everything in my career, the moment people ask me about most often was when Gazza got booked in that semi-final. ‘I could see his bottom lip was going. I think it says a lot about Bobby that it was him I turned to, to ask him to have a word. ‘Bobby knew instinctively when to scold him and when to put an arm round his shoulder. Gazza was an emotional guy and I know he exasperated Bobby on occasions but Bobby was brilliant at connecting with people.’ Remembering Robson - the miner’s son who was raised in a County Durham pit village - Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘I was never too big or proud to ask him for advice, which he gave freely and unconditionally. Thoughts: The FA will honour the former England manager with a Sir Bobby Robson Day celebration . Giving: The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation has raised £7.3m for cancer research, treatment and care . ‘His character was hewn out of the coalface; developed by the County Durham mining background that he came from. ‘His parents instilled in him the discipline and standards which forged the character of a colossal human being.’ Lineker and Ferguson’s words have been, and will continue to be, echoed by the game’s greatest; from Alan Shearer to Ronaldo to Jose Mourinho. But it is Robson’s own words which best capture the emotion he still manages to evoke. In his book, My Kind of Toon, Robson wrote: ‘What is a club in any case? Joy: Paul Gascoigne pictured hugging England manager Bobby Robson after England's victory over Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup quater-final . Down: Gascoigne being consoled by Robson during England's 1990 World Cup semi-final with West Germany . ‘Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. ‘It’s not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. ‘It’s the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. ‘It’s a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his father’s hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.’ Robson was real. He cared, not only about his players, but every supporter who walked through the turnstile. He had been one of them as a boy at Newcastle’s St James’ Park and never lost sight of that. And that is why football will never lose sight of Robson – be it five years or 50, the grandfather of football will never get old. Sharing a joke: Robson flies back from the 1982 World Cup with then-manager Ron Greenwood . Jose Mourinho, who worked with Robson at Barcelona. ‘I will keep with me always the Bobby Robson of every day, a person who had extraordinary passion for life and for football, with an extraordinary enthusiasm. ‘Bobby Robson is one of those people who never die, not so much for what he did in his career, for one victory more or less, but for what he knew to give to those who had, like me, the good fortune to know him and walk by his side.’ Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker Robson described as one of his greatest players. ‘It makes me feel happy to hear how highly Sir Bobby talked about me because he’s a legend of football. ‘I’m proud to have worked with him. He was an awesome coach and an awesome person. He was like a father to me. ‘I have had a lot of managers in football but the difference between all of them and Sir Bobby was his humanity and the relationships he had with the players. He was always like a father to everyone.’ Legend: Ronaldo scoring for Brazil against Germany in the 2002 World Cup final in Japan . Steve Harper, his Newcastle goalkeeper with a more light-hearted recollection. ‘We were once training at Chester-le-Street and a guy was trying to land a helicopter on a newly seeded pitch. ‘Sir Bobby was underneath the blades, whirling round three feet over his head, shouting, “What you doing, what you doing?” pointing him back over the fence. He was nearly decapitated, protecting the grass as if he had paid for every seed.’ Alan Shearer, whose career he rejuvenated at Newcastle. ‘I was disillusioned (before Robson came in as manager), I wasn’t enjoying the game. I wasn’t scoring goals and wasn’t playing as I knew I could. ‘He knew me as a person, I’d spoken to him many times. He knew me as a player. He tried to buy me when he was manager at Barcelona, and he just came in and he got me playing in a different way. ‘He got me playing again with a smile on my face and enjoying football. If it wasn’t for him then certainly my Newcastle career would have ended early. ‘He was just a unique man. He was able to light the dressing room up. Because of his experience and because of the respect that everyone had for him when he spoke people listened. ‘And when he spoke and asked you to do well you wanted to do well for him because you liked him and you adored him and you felt for him and you felt the pressures and the pain he was going through. He had that aura about him. ‘He will never, ever be beaten.’", "reference": "Thursday marks the anniversary of Sir Bobby Robson's passing at the age of 76 .\nThe former England and Newcastle manager's life must be celebrated .\nThe Sir Bobby Robson Foundation has raised £7.3m for cancer research .\nThe FA will honour the former England manager with a Sir Bobby Robson Day celebration ."}

Leo Bonten, from Spijkenisse in the Netherlands, is hoping his creation will fetch more than £78,000 so that he can buy himself a prosthetic limb. The 53-year-old had his right leg leg surgically removed after contracting a bacterial infection when he broke it in an accident in July 2012. Plan: Mr Bonten is hoping the sale of his leg lamp will help him to raise money for a prosthetic leg . A friend had tried to push him into a paddling pool when the pair slipped, and the friend landing on top of Mr Bonten, snapping his leg. Mr Bonten decided he wanted to make 'the world's only leg lamp' after being told that he was going to have to have it amputated - and that the limb would be incinerated. However, he was told that the leg would be the property of the hospital that removed it. As he told Dutch publication NRC Reader: 'My leg is my property. People keep their kidney stones in a jar on the mantelpieces. Ashes of deceased people are included in tattoos. 'I’m going to make a lamp of my leg.' Mirror image: Mr Bonten places his left foot beside his amputated right foot which is now in the lamp . Crutches: Mr Bonten is using crutches as he tries to accumulate enough money for a prosthetic leg . The hospital finally agreed to allow Mr Bonten to keep his leg after it was removed, and it was then he moved forward with his idea to raise funds for a prosthesis. Mr Bonten sought the assistance of pathologist Frank van de Goot to help him preserve his leg - and he now hopes an 'eccentric billionaire' will decide to purchase the extraordinary household accessory. During the video, Mr Bonten can be seen walking on crutches and speaking about how the idea for the leg lamp was initiated. He said: 'I want to sell the leg, the leg lamp. Because the prosthetic leg I'm going to get from the insurance, I wouldn't be able to do a lot with it. Artistic: The unusual and unique leg lamp was created by designer Willem Schaperkotter . 'And I want to have a prosthetic leg that would be capable to do a lot of things but that costs some money.' On Sunday Mr Bonten was putting together the details for the sale of the lamp which was created by designer Willem Schaperkotter. Mr Bonten added: 'I'm hoping an eccentric billionaire who thinks 'well, that's the only leg lamp in the world. 'It's the first person who made a lamp out of [an] amputated leg, and I want to have it. Because it's the only one in the world, [it's] unique.' He initially put his leg lamp for sale on website eBay but the listing was subsequently taken down as eBay does not allow the sale of human remains or body parts.", "reference": "Leo Bonten, 53, had his leg amputated after he broke it and it got infected .\nPathologist Frank van de Goot preserved limb so it could be used for lamp .\nHe hopes an 'eccentric billionaire' will buy the  lamp for £78,000 so he can afford to a prosthetic leg ."}

The PS4 goes on sale for £349 in the UK and $399 in the U.S, while the Xbox One costs £429 and $499. However, Sony is selling its console at a loss according to figures from analytics firm IHS. The Colorado-based company found that the bill of materials (BOM) for the PS4 equates to $372, plus manufacturing costs taking it up $381. This is $18 less than the retail price. Birmingham gamers also spend the most money on gaming a year at £253 per person ahead of Liverpool on £228 and Manchester on £223. The research was commissioned by Domino’s Pizza to celebrate the launch of Microsoft’s Xbox One on Friday and Sony’s PlayStation 4 the week after. According to the study, although men were willing to give up a night of passion, or even going to the toilet, they were less likely than women to skip spending time with their friends. Women even said they’d missed funerals in order to play their games, yet almost 85 per cent of men said they would never miss a stag do, wedding or important event.

{"id": 15321, "article": "(CNN) -- The United Nations is holding a summit this week in Rio de Janeiro on global sustainable development, but, incredibly, family planning is not on the agenda. How can the summit ignore this elephant in the room? When the world's population hit 7 billion in October, experts warned that if nothing is done, the global population could grow by another 3.5 billion by 2050. Still, many of the world's women are without the resources to plan their families' growth effectively -- a major factor in stemming the tide of global population expansion. Clearly, the world's growing population and the significant challenges it poses must be central to any discussion of sustainable development at the U.N. Earth Summit, also called Rio+20, taking place Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Negotiators hammering out the terms for discussion in Rio failed to link the summit's sustainable development goals to the concerns, needs and desires of women worldwide -- particularly to the role that family planning could play in easing the burdens posed by population growth. We know that when women have access to voluntary family planning services, supplies and information, society sees enormous gains in each of the three pillars of sustainable development -- human development, economic growth and environmental sustainability. Without it, families, communities and natural resources are extraordinarily burdened. Experts estimate that more than 215 million women around the world want to delay or space childbirth but are not using modern contraception. In fact, meeting this need would cost $3.6 billion per year, a small amount when you consider the enormous benefits. Providing modern contraception also has the potential to stem population growth and relieve human pressure on the environment and natural resources. We urge governments and global agencies at Rio to make this a priority. We are at a moment in history where we still have time to make a difference. It is essential that the global discussion in Rio not be blind to the potential solutions that access to voluntary family planning could offer to many of the world's problems. Our goal is not to control the population: It is to empower women and families, giving them a say over when they will bring another child into this world. We know that when a woman can plan the size of her family, she is healthier, more likely to finish her education, join the labor force, become more economically productive and engage in politics, thus more effectively shaping the future of her family and her country. We also know that when governments invest simultaneously in voluntary family planning, public health and education, countries can benefit from the \"demographic dividend\" seen in the Asian Tiger countries. Frustratingly, instead of recognizing these links, Rio negotiators so far have sidelined them. Every second, every day, every year we fail to address demand for reproductive health and family planning services. Lives are lost and girls' opportunities to thrive and contribute to their country's development shrink. These are real people. We know that universal access to voluntary family planning services would prevent 150,000 maternal deaths and 25 million abortions every year. This is an issue all governments and negotiators should agree upon if we are serious about sustainable development. Today, opposition to voluntary family planning can only be attributed at best to outdated thinking, and at worst to a desire to undermine women's rights. If the motto of the Rio conference is to be realized, that is, to build \"the future we want,\" leaders must step up and call for universal access to reproductive health and voluntary family planning for women everywhere who are denied this right. Consider the wider benefits to our planet. Providing women with the desired cost-effective, low-tech family planning services would not only dramatically reduce pressure on natural resources, increase supplies of food and water, decrease the risk of conflict over other scarce resources and improve ecological health, but scientists estimate such services would cut carbon emissions by up to one-quarter of what's needed to slow climate change -- an outcome equal to ending deforestation around the world, or increasing 40-fold our reliance on wind power. My 15 colleagues and I on the Global Leaders Council for Reproductive Health, most of us former national leaders, call on our fellow leaders and negotiators not to ignore the elephant in the room. They must find the political will to make reproductive health fundamental to implementing sustainable development as a major outcome at Rio. At stake are the very goals the conference is meant to embrace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jenny Shipley.", "reference": "Jenny Shipley: Rio summit on sustainable development must address population growth .\nShipley: Family planning is essential to summit's goal, yet it's not on agenda .\nShipley says 215 million women who want to plan families have no access to birth control .\nShipley: Family planning enormously benefits women's lives, the planet, economies ."}

The star of the upcoming film 'Elysium' told BET that he and the president 'no longer see eye-to-eye.' 'There are a lot of things that I really question, he said, specifically about the Obama administration's national security posture. 'The legality of the drone strikes,' Damon said, 'and these NSA revelations are – like, you know – Jimmy Carter came out and said we don’t live in a democracy. That’s a little intense when an ex-president says that. So you know, he’s got some explaining to do, particularly for a constitutional law professor.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In August 2011, Damon told reporters that he was 'really dissatisfied' with Obama 'doubling down' on George W. Bush's 'bad ideas' for education . What a difference four years can make: Damon campaigned aggressively for Obama in 2008 . Obama has come under fire for presiding over an NSA with a mandate for domestic spying. The agency's biggest secrets are now exposed publicly since contractor Edward Snowden leaked them to the press and fled to Russia. And the president has faced growing outrage from Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and other libertarian-minded Republicans, following his Department of Justice's longtime refusal to guarantee that it won't use drones to surveil Americans – an assurance it gave only in the face of an embarrassing Senate filibuster. The White House continues to use unmanned drones as first-strike weapons against terrorism targets overseas. Damon campaigned aggressively for then-Senator Obama during the 2008 election season. Nine days before the 2008 election, Damon told a room full of volunteers in Florida that they should work hard to ‘make sure Barack wins’ But in the president's second term, the bloom is clearly off the rose. In Elysium, a crew of gun-toting officers secures the line between the Occupy-inspired 1 per cent and the rest of humanity .

Three . months later in an interview with Elle magazine he said, 'I've talked . to a lot of people who worked for Obama at the grassroots level. One of . them said to me, \"Never again. I will never be fooled again by a . politician.\"' 'You . know,' he added, 'a one-term president with some balls who actually got . stuff done would have been, in the long run of the country, much . better.' Damon's criticism of Obama began in late 2010, and by April 2011 the president was ready to fire back, albeit in good fun. 'It's fair to say that when it comes to my presidency, the honeymoon is over,' he at the White House Correspondents Dinner. 'Matt Damon said he was disappointed in my performance. Well Matt, I just saw The Adjustment Bureau so right back atcha buddy.' Nine days before the 2008 presidential election, Damon visited an Obama volunteer center in South Florida, urging dozens of students to 'make sure Barack wins' Damon has come under fire this week following revelations that despite his long-term advocacy for improving public education, he sends his own children to a private school. 'II pay for a private education and I’m trying to get the one that most matches the public education that I had,' he told The Guardian, 'but that kind of progressive education no longer exists in the public system. It’s unfair.' During a 2011 rally in Washington D.C., Damon told a crowd of teachers that he would not trade his own public school education 'for anything.' His film 'Elysium' which opens Friday, has been panned by conservatives for arguing for a socialist utopia as an alternative to a future world of haves and have-nots. The Occupy Wall Street-inspired plot line involves a wealthy elite class that has abandoned an overcrowded Earth for a luxury space station, leaving the rest of humanity in crime-ridden and poverty-stricken squalor.

{"id": 15324, "article": "(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement . No injuries were reported. \"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July of last year, human rights monitors expressed concerns that longstanding grievances could again lead to violence consuming the region. In November, there were several days of bombings near an entry point for refugees at the border, the United Nations reported. It did not specify who launched the bombs.", "reference": "Rev.

{"id": 15327, "article": "A man who was sentenced to die yesterday, is now under investigation for five more capital crimes in a different state. A Pennsylvania jury deliberated for seven hours on Tuesday, before coming to the decision to send 40-year-old Charles Ray Hicks to death row for the January 2008 murder of Scranton woman Deanna Null, 36. Prosecutors said Hicks beheaded Null alive, before chopping up the rest of her body and dumping the remains in black bags scattered along  interstate roads. The remains were recovered by investigators, who also found Null's severed hands hidden in the walls of Hicks' Tobyhanna home. On Monday, the day before he was sentenced, Hicks allegedly confessed to murdering five more women in Texas before he moved to Pennsylvania, prosecutor Michael Mancuso said. Hicks is originally from Fort Worth. Scroll down for video . Going to death row: Charles Hicks, 40, is seen leaving court on Tuesday after receiving the death penalty for the January 2008 murder of 36-year-old Deanna Null . 'As I understand it, yesterday he made certain admissions that he killed some women down there,' Mancuso said. 'And that's going to also be investigated and may result in charges.' Both Pennsylvania and Texas have the death penalty, but Texas follows through on executing their death row inmate at a higher rate than any other state. This year alone, 10 people have been executed by lethal injection in Texas compared to just three people in the past two decades in Pennsylvania, despite the state having one of the largest death row populations. More victims: Before he was sentenced on Tuesday, Hicks (right, in 2008) allegedly admitted to murdering five other women in Texas. Pennsylvania victim Deanna Null (left) who was 36 at the time of her death in 2008 . It's still unclear how these new admissions will impact Hicks' death sentence in Pennsylvania, or which state would handle the execution if Hicks is convicted of capital crimes in Texas. MailOnline's calls to Mancuso were not immediately returned Wednesday morning. Hicks himself showed relatively little emotion as he received the life-ending news on Tuesday, but reporters in court said his eyes filled with tears. His sisters attended the hearing and started sobbing when they heard the decision. Hicks' sister and mother defended him in court on Monday, pleading the jury to use mercy in deciding the sentence. However, the 12-person jury, which included eight females and four males, eventually decided on the death sentence after determining that Hicks tortured Null before she died. In Pennsylvania, all capital crimes must include proof of an aggravated circumstance, such as torture. In the middle of their deliberations, a jury member was sent back into court to get the legal definition of torture from the judge. The decision did not appear to be an easy one for the jury, as two members were seen wiping away tears as the sentence was read. Hicks' family weren't the only ones to defend his character in court on Monday either, a former cell mate and prison guard testified that he should be spared the death penalty. Jerel Johnson shared a cell with Hicks when he was on trial for murder charge he has since been acquitted of. Thought he was in a 'very dark place' at the time, Hicks helped him get through it. A former prison guard who now volunteers to teach bible study classes as a Jehovah's Witness says several inmates in his group look to Hicks for wisdom. However, those views were countered by a former fiancée who said Hicks became a different person when he started abusing drugs and that he once threatened to kill her. Hicks' case is far from over since all death penalties are automatically reviewed by the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, which can cancel a death sentence. Hicks will formally be sentenced on January 6.", "reference": "Charles Ray Hicks, 40, was sentenced to death on Tuesday for the January 2008 murder of 36-year-old Deanna Null .\nNull's body was found dismembered and strewn the side of Pennsylvania interstates, and her severed hands hidden in the walls of Hicks' home .\nBefore he heard his sentence on Tuesday, Hicks allegedly admitted to killing five other women in Texas ."}
{"id": 15328, "article": "(CNN) -- With Rory McIlroy, the world's second-ranked golfer, and defending champion Luke Donald not surviving the cut at the PGA Championship, the door was opened for others at the European Tour's flagship event. Spain's Alejandro Canizares took advantage, leading at Wentworth in England heading into the final day after registering a four-under 68 to move to nine-under 207 overall. Canizares, whose lone European Tour title came in Russia seven years ago, was forced to skip this month's China Open after being diagnosed with viral meningitis. \"I'm not at full strength but it's working for me, so I'm not going to complain,\" said Canizares, the son of Ryder Cup veteran Jose Maria Canizares. Matteo Manassero of Italy, at 20 bidding to become the youngest winner of the event, and Scotland's Marc Warren sit tied for third at seven-under, a shot better than Ireland's Shane Lowry. But it's the player in second, England's Lee Westwood, who might fancy his chances Sunday. Westwood, twice a runner-up at Wentworth, a Ryder Cup stalwart and the only member of the top five inside the top 50 in the world rankings, is a single shot behind Canizares. Westwood, who recorded a 67 in the third round, said it would be \"ironic\" if he won the title months after moving his family from England to Florida. Although not matching the weather in Florida, Saturday's conditions were significantly better than chilly Thursday and Friday. \"It would be great and I am after as many wins as I can get, but it's a crowded leaderboard and I will have to play as well, if not better than I did today,\" Westwood said. \"I felt much more in tune with my swing and had a lot better distance and direction control with my irons and set up a lot of chances. \"It was one of the most fun days I have ever had on a golf course. It was good to see a lot more smiling faces and a lot more people prepared to take their hands out of their pockets and applaud. \"I also get great support here but even more so today.\" Another golfer that praised the spectators was Spain's Sergio Garcia. Garcia came under fire this week and issued an apology for his \"fried chicken\" jibe. He considered pulling out of the tournament. But Garcia played, made the cut and remains in contention, tied for sixth at five-under. \"The crowds here, I don't have words to explain what I feel towards them,\" Garcia, last a winner on the European Tour in 2011, said. \"They have been amazing, every single tee, every single green, cheering me on, and I can never pay them back.\" Also tied for sixth is the halfway leader, Italian Francesco Molinari, who slumped to a 73 in the third round. Popular Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, the oldest man in the event at 49, registered a 67 to rise to a tie for 14th at four-under.

{"id": 15329, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Bob Barker, the former host of \"The Price Is Right,\" made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses. At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty. \"How do they train them? They have to dominate the animal,\" Barker said. \"How do they dominate the animal? They beat it, with clubs, fists, black jacks, ax handles, golf clubs. They shock it with all sorts of electric devices. They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks.\" Barker, who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection, is championing the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act. The bill, which would amend the existing Animal Welfare Act, has attracted bipartisan support. The bill would affect only traveling shows. It specifically exempts zoos, aquariums and research labs and rodeos. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans, \"how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation's moral character.\" Dr. Mel Richardson of Animal Defenders International lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most, if not all, lions, tigers and elephants in traveling shows: \"Imagine living all of your life on a queen-size or king-size bed.\" But the concerns are not confined to their housing. Jan Creamer, president of ADI, said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment. Barker's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of \"CSI\" and \"The West Wing,\" who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals, and taking them off the road. \"Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun. ... If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they'd actually be very disappointed in us, for [going] to these places,\" Fox said. A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities, and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas, have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals. Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation. Similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Portugal and India. And, according to the panel, more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit. \"It is time for the United States to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing,\" Barker said.", "reference": "Bob Barker urges passage of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act .\nIn a Capitol Hill news conference, he tells of violence used to train animals .\nAnimal protection advocate tells of confined lives of large show animals .\nActress Jorga Fox: \"Our kids look to us to do what is right\""}
{"id": 15330, "article": "By . Richard Shears . An English national has been arrested in Cambodia for allegedly molesting a young boy, less than a month after another British paedophile was sent to jail for 10 years. The arrest of 36-year-old Richard William Fruin, from Gloucestershire, for allegedly abusing an eight-year-old boy follows the jailing earlier this month of paedophile David Fletcher, 67, from Norwich, who had been convicted of raping a number of children living in a slum. Fruin, who has a conviction for child pornography in the UK, was charged with molesting the eight-year-old after he was found sleeping with the youngster in a guest house in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. Richard William Fruin had been staying at the Boeung Meas guesthouse in the capital of Cambodia . Police said Fruin, who fled to Cambodia after serving a year in prison in Britain for producing child pornography, was found with the boy when police raided the Boeung Meas guesthouse. He has already made one brief court appearance this week and is expected to be brought before a magistrate again early next month. ‘We are still investigating to determine whether or not he had sex with the boy,’ Lieutenant Colonel Lao Lin, who heads the country’s anti-human trafficking department, told the Cambodia Daily. Police have established that Fruin has been working as an English teacher in Phnom Penh following his recent arrival in the country. Fruin has been charged with molesting the eight-year-old after he was found sleeping with the youngster in this guest house in Phnom Penh . His known record of paedophilia goes back to 2005 when he was charged at Gloucester Crown Court with 15 counts of producing child pornography. He was released on bail and fled the country for seven years. According to the anti-paedophile organisation Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) he travelled to Africa and South East Asia before returning to the UK last year, where he was re-arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. On his release, he flew to Cambodia. Cambodia was once the haunt of child molester Gary Glitter . ‘He has a history of abuse and the police have found many more [Cambodian] victims,’ Mr Khoem Vando, deputy director of project management at APLE told The Cambodian Daily. The mother of the young boy found with Fruin on Sunday night claimed that all three of her sons - including two aged 10 and 11 - told police they had been abused by the paedophile. ‘If police had not taken any action last night, I don’t know what he would have done to my son,’ the woman told the paper. She said that Fruin had been visiting her shop in Phnom Penh for about a month and had previously taken her two older sons to his guest house. ‘I had no idea that he intended to hurt my children,’ she said. Miss Pen Chantha, owner of the guesthouse, said Fruin had been staying there for about a month. ‘I was shocked when the police came to arrest him,’ she said. ‘I never saw anything strange while he was staying at my guesthouse.’ If convicted on a single charge of purchasing a child for prostitution, Fruin could be sent to jail for up to five years. Police said it was possible more charges could follow. Cambodia has for years been the haunt of paedophiles from Britain and other European countries. It was where notorious child molester Gary Glitter lived before he fled to Vietnam as authorities started moving in on him. He served prison time in Vietnam before being deported to the UK. Paedophile David Fletcher, 67, from Norwich, was sent to the notorious Prey Sar Prison in Cambodia after he was convicted of raping a number of children a month before paedophile Richard William Fruin was arrested . When Fruin, from Stroud, appeared in court in Gloucester last year it was revealed that among provocative photographs found at his home were pictures of a 14-year-old boy called Luke Harrison. A 21-year-old builder at the time of Fruin's court appearance in 2012, Mr Harrison plunged to his death from a Cornish cliff top during a football tour earlier in the year. Prosecutor Tim Hills told the court that in 2005, when Fruin was first arrested, he was associating with the young Mr Harrison and had taken him to a farmhouse in Worcester - where indecent pictures of him were taken. Mr Hills told the court that Fruin's offences came to light after a postman tried to deliver a parcel to his home, a package that was in fact addressed to Luke Harrison. The postman refused to hand the parcel over to Fruin, who snatched it. The postman reported Fruin for theft, resulting in police searching his home and finding 'evidence of drug use'. Police had expected to find further incriminating drug evidence on Fruin's computers, but instead discovered pornographic films and pictures, most of them from the internet - but there were others of Mr Harrison in provocative poses.", "reference": "Richard William Fruin has been charged with molesting the child .\nThe 36-year-old was found sleeping in the same bed with the youngster .\nFruin fled to Cambodia after serving a year in prison in Britain for producing child pornography .\nMother of the young boy claims all three of her sons told police they had been abused by the paedophile ."}
{"id": 15331, "article": "Detectives don't know for certain what led a father to kill his wife and two teenage children before burning down their $1.6million  mansion and committing suicide last May, but they did find evidence of mounting tension in the weeks leading up to the tragic incident. The bodies of the four members of the Campbell family were discovered six months ago in the Avila, Florida home they were renting from retired tennis professional James Blake. Investigators determined that Darrin Campbell was the family member to carry out the horrifying murders of his wife Kimberly, 51, and their children Collin, 18, and Megan, 16, before setting fire to the house and killing himself. Scroll down for video . Why? Darrin Campbell (left) shot dead his wife Kimberly (right) and their teenage children Collin and Megan last May before burning down their $1.6million mansion and committing suicide. Hillsborough County, Florida sheriff's detectives finished their investigation into the murders and suicide but have found for no motive for the attack . Strict dad: A report published Wednesday does show some signs of tension in the Campbell household. Campbell was allegedly disappointed when his 18-year-old son Collin (left) did not get a scholarship to a Division I college for baseball. And daughter Megan (right), 16, started showing bruises on her body in the weeks leading up to her death, friends told investigators . What they don't know is why. In a report published Wednesday, marking an end to the investigation, detectives wrote that they have no motive for the crime. 'I don’t know if we will ever know exactly why everything happened the way it did,' sheriff’s spokeswoman Debbie Carter told the Tampa Bay Tribune. However, the report did reveal several seemingly small issues that could have mounted to something more, inspiring Campbell to commit the shocking annihilation of his family. Those issues include some financial stress, trouble at Campbell's work and in his marriage as well as reports of strict parenting concerning son Collin's baseball prospects and new bruises appearing on daughter Megan's body. Remains: Investigators say the family had some debts but appeared to be financially solvent for the most part. They were up to date with rent on the $1.6million mansion they rented from former tennis professional James Blake. A picture of the home after the incident last May, above . Investigators say that the Campbell family had some outstanding debt, which mounted at the beginning of the year, but it appeared the family's finances were mostly solvent, since they were up to date with rent and maintained a $4,000 average balance in their checking account. 'It is obvious that some financial distress occurred after the first of the year,' the report reads. 'Those balances that would normally be paid off, were not and then carried forward after January 2014. Also, bills that were paid by Kimberly began being partially paid by Darrin or not paid at all.' Kimberly's friends said she seemed to have no trouble spending money on a nice hotel in Nashville, Tennessee the weekend before her murder, at which point she also shelled out for a pair of $250 shoes. However, there did seem to be troubles in her marriage. Blaze: The week before her murder, Kimberly went on a girl's trip with her friends scheduled the weekend of her anniversary. She allegedly told her friends that she and her husband 'don't talk much anymore' Stocking up: It appears Campbell planned the murders and his suicide. He purchased the gun used in the attack, and cans of oil and fireworks to burn down the house in the weeks leading up to May 7 . 'Kim said it was their anniversary, but that her and Darren don’t talk much anymore.' friend Amy Jordan told investigators. An investigator concluded in the report though that they 'did not get the feeling that there was anything going wrong in the relationship between Darrin and Kim.' Landlord: Above, former American tennis professional James Blake. Blake owned the house where the Campbells were living at the time of the murders . While Campbell was described as a caring and involved father, his children allegedly told friends about his strict and controlling behavior. Collin's high school baseball coach says Campbell had unrealistic expectations about his son's college prospects, and that he became upset when the average player only got an offer to play at a Division II college, instead of a larger Division I school. In the weeks leading up to the attacks, daughter Megan's friends began noticing fresh bruises on her body which the 16-year-old attributed to dance injuries. Friends say though that Megan had been dancing for years and they had never noticed the injuries before. The night of her death, Megan was supposed to spend the night at a friend's house, but she cancelled at the last minute saying her dad was making her stay at home for 'family time' - something he had allegedly never done before. And it appears Campbell planned the murders some time in advance. He purchased a .40 caliber handgun, fireworks and oil in the weeks before the shooting and just two days before asked for a leave of absence from his work where he was the chief operating officer of a digital services company. That request led one employee to text Campbell to ask if he was ok. Campbell responded to that message two days later with a 'no' sent at 3:25am the morning of the murders.

{"id": 15332, "article": "Singapore (CNN) -- A police investigation into one man's death has now become an issue between two countries. Singapore's Foreign Ministry on Sunday said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the attempt of two U.S. senators to block funding to the country's state-backed Institute of Microelectronics in a dispute over the investigation into the death of American who had worked there. U.S. Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester of Montana recently introduced a measure to block U.S. funding to the institute until U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder certifies that the FBI had full access to all evidence related to the death of research engineer Shane Todd. Todd's parents, who are from Montana, had raised the issue with the senators in early March. Baucus told reporters in Washington that he will work until he is \"satisfied that the parents have closure, and I am convinced there has been no national security breach or improper transfer of technology that puts America at risk.\" According to a statement from the senators, in 2010, IME received nearly $500,000 from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military. It was unclear what proportion of IME's overall budget the U.S. funds amounted to. Parents call death suspicious . Todd was found hanged in his apartment in June, just days after resigning from a job at IME. His death was reportedly called a suicide in initial reports by a Singapore coroner. A further investigation is under way in Singapore before a final coroner's report. Todd's parents consider their son's death suspicious and think he could have been killed because of his work on a semiconductor project between IME and the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. READ: Montana family disputes Singapore police probe into son's death . The Singapore police last week issued a statement asserting that they were cooperating with the FBI and said they also told the FBI they will share evidence obtained so far \"in accordance with the legal framework of both countries.\" The senators' latest move came despite a meeting between Baucus and Singapore's Foreign Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday. Shanmugam has said IME is subject to \"rigorous internal audits\" and offered to allow the United States to conduct its own \"process audit\" of IME as well. Hard drive holds evidence? Singapore police have also sought help from the FBI to obtain a hard drive that had been in Shane Todd's apartment and may contain relevant evidence. His parents say they found the drive in their son's apartment after police had already conducted their search. They also have said that experts who've examined the drive say someone accessed the drive after Todd's death. The parents have told CNN they are holding the drive \"at an undisclosed location.\" Both IME and Huawei have denied any joint projects related to Todd's work were being conducted. Security concerns . Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment makers. Along with its Chinese rival ZTE, it has been seeking to expand its business in Western markets. But at times, the two companies have met with resistance over security concerns and fears over their ties to the Chinese government. In October, a report prepared by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee said that \"the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to U.S. critical infrastructure could undermine core U.S. national-security interests.\" The two Chinese firms disputed the reports' findings, saying their products were safe for use in the United States. Todd's parents say his work had involved the use of an advanced semiconductor material Gallium Nitride, which has both commercial and military applications. They say he had expressed concerns about the legality of his work and whether it could be harmful to U.S. security. Singapore denies there were any illegal transfers of technology between IME and Huawei. In a statement from Singapore's Foreign Ministry, Singapore also objected to the \"pressure\" in this case and said the country has \"made every effort to be open and transparent in both the investigation of Mr. Todd's death and the IME's projects.\" \"We will let the outcome of the investigation and coroner's inquiry speak for themselves.\"", "reference": "Montana senators aim to stop funding Singapore firm after U.S. employee's death .\nResearch engineer Shane Todd was found hanged in his apartment last June .\nSingapore coroner called it a suicide, but Todd's family says his death was suspicious .\nTodd was working on semiconductor material Gallium Nitride, which has military uses ."}

A Chicago man has been arrested after he repeatedly tried to run into his burning house and save his beloved dog from a fire. Police say that Samuel Lee Bassett lashed out and punched an officer after cops handcuffed and restrained him when he wouldn't stop trying to run into the blaze on Friday afternoon at his home in Chicago's Morgan Park neighborhood. Three firefighters became trapped in the basement and had to be hospitalized while battling the intense fire. Bassett's dog died in the blaze. The Chicago Tribune reports that Bassett, a 48-year-old US Air Force veteran, wasn't home when the fire broke out. He returned to find his home fully engulfed in flames with firefighters already inside. He frantically tried to get inside his house to save his dog, firefighters said, and resisted their attempts to keep him away from the blaze. When police handcuffed and detained Bassett, he allegedly punched one of the officers in the face, leaving a cut on the bridge of his nose. Officers responded by hitting him in the face with a pair of handcuffs, the Tribune reports. He is charged with resisting the police and two counts of felony aggravated battery on a police officer. A judge ordered him held on $300,000 bail. Three firefighters became trapped after getting lost and disoriented in the basement of the home while battling the blaze.

{"id": 15334, "article": "(Wired) -- No more will soldiers' vision be limited to the socket-embedded spheres that God intended. The Pentagon now wants troops to see dangers lurking behind them in real time, and be able to tell if an object a kilometer away is a walking stick or an AK-47. In a solicitation released today, Darpa, the Pentagon's far-out research branch, unveiled the Soldier Centric Imaging via Computational Cameras effort, or SCENICC. Imagine a suite of cameras that digitally capture a kilometer-wide, 360-degree sphere, representing the image in 3-D onto a wearable eyepiece. You'd be able to literally see all around you, including behind yourself, and zooming in at will, creating a \"stereoscopic/binocular system, simultaneously providing 10x zoom to both eyes.\" And you would do this all hands-free, apparently by barking out or pre-programming a command (the solicitation leaves it up to a designer's imagination) to adjust focus. Then comes the Terminator-vision. Darpa wants the eyepiece to include \"high-resolution computer-enhanced imagery as well as task-specific non-image data products such as mission data overlays, threat warnings/alerts, targeting assistance, etc.\" Target identified: Sarah Connor... The \"Full Sphere Awareness\" tool will provide soldiers with \"muzzle flash detection,\" \"projectile tracking\" and \"object recognition/labeling,\" basically pointing key information out to them. And an \"integrated weapon sighting\" function locks your gun on your target when acquired. That's far beyond an app mounted on your rifle that keeps track of where your friendlies and enemies are. The imaging wouldn't just be limited to what any individual soldier sees. SCENICC envisions a \"networked optical sensing capability\" that fuses images taken from nodes worn by \"collections of soldiers and/or unmanned vehicles.\" The Warrior-Alpha drone overhead? Its full-motion video and still images would be sent into your eyepiece. It also has to be ridiculously lightweight, weighing less than 700 grams for the entire system -- including a battery powerful enough to \"exceed 24 hours [usage] under normal conditions.\" That's about a pound and a half, maximum. The Army's experimental ensemble of wearable gadgets weighs about eight pounds. And it is to SCENICC what your Roomba is to the T-1000. Here's how far advanced SCENICC is compared to bleeding-edge imaging and networking capabilities that the Army is currently developing. Right now, the Army's asking three different companies -- Raytheon, Rockwell Collins and General Dynamics -- to build a wearable platform of digital maps, computers and radios, networked with one another. Soldiers would have warzone maps beamed onto helmet-mounted eyepieces. The system, known as Nett Warrior, needs to weigh less than eight pounds, and it builds on a years-long and ultimately fruitless effort called Land Warrior. (One of the problems with Land Warrior is it was heavy and cumbersome, owing in part to battery weight.) The Army hopes to choose one of the Nett Warrior designs by March. By the time it'll actually roll out Nett Warrior after testing, production and deployment -- a few years, optimistically -- SCENICC will already be hard at work on its replacement. Darpa wants a hands-free zooming function within two years of work on the contract. By year three, the computer-enhanced vision tool needs to be ready. Year four is for 360-degree vision. Then it's on to development. The Army is generally hot for combat-ready smartphones to keep soldiers linked up with each other. And the buzz-generating tool for the soldier of the near future is mapping technology, delivered onto a smartphone or some other handheld mobile device, at least judging from this year's Association of the U.S. Army confab. But all of these representation tools are two-dimensional, and require soldiers to look away from their patrols in order to use them. Textron's SoldierEyes Common Operating Picture, for instance, lets soldiers see icons on a tablet-mounted map telling them where their friends, enemies and neutrals are. It can't put those icons onto a 3-D picture sent to a soldier's eyes, let alone allow a 10x zoom for a kilo-wide 360-degree field of vision. Why would anyone use a map on a smartphone when they could have SCENICC? Even with all the advances in digital imaging, it'll be a tall order to put together 360-degree vision and 10x zoom and mapping software and integration with weapons systems and lightweight miniaturization and network connectivity. Darpa doesn't really address how the system's networked optics would work in low-bandwidth areas like, say, eastern Afghanistan (though maybe drone-borne cell towers can help). Indeed, judging from the solicitation, while SCENICC is supposed to be networked, it doesn't seem to have any communications requirements for soldiers to talk through what their optics are sharing with each other. Maybe there's a role for those new soldier smartphones after all. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

{"id": 15335, "article": "South Africa’s hopes of qualifying for the quarter finals at the Africa Cup of Nations hang by a thread after they drew with Senegal in Mongomo. Oupa Manyisa rounded off a fine move with a clinical finish early in the second half to give Shakes Mashaba’s side the lead, but Serigne Mbodji, bizarrely wearing gloves despite the stifling jungle heat, leveled things up 15 minutes later with a towering header. The result puts Senegal top of the competitions’s ‘Group of Death’, a point ahead of both Ghana and Algeria, but Bafana Bafana must win their final game against the Black Stars to have any chance of progression. South Africa's Tokelo Rantie (right) celebrates Oupa Manyisa's opening goal against Senegal . Senegal's defender Kara Mbodji (right) celebrates after scoring the equaliser against South Africa . After a first half of few chances, the game came to life in the second, with Manyisa’s goal igniting a crowd that had already watched 135 minutes of football with barely a shot on target following the bore-fest earlier between the group's other two sides. A neat move saw Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie create space and feed Thuso Phala down the right. His low cross found Oupa Manyisa at the back post and the Orlando Pirates winger made no mistake, slotting coolly past Coundoul. As it had in their previous game against Ghana, going a goal behind brough Senegal out of their shells. They had shaded the possession from the off, but aside from an early run from Southampton’s Sadio Mane, returning from injury after missing the win over Ghana with a troublesome hamstring, the Senegalese carried little threat from open play, despite their array of forwards. However, when the majority of your team are over six foot and built like a fleet of tanks, set pieces will always be a threat. South Africa's goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane clears the ball during the Group C clash . South Africa's Dean Furman (left) challenges Senegal's Pape Kouli Diopi for possession . And so it proved. Having gone close several times - Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf the most culpable – and having had a Mane goal disallowed correctly for offside, finally the Senegalese superiority in the air told. Mbodji got up highest at the back post and powered a header over Thapelo Mabokgwane to equalize. The keeper was not directly at fault, but it was his uncertainty under the high ball that contributed to South Africa’s nervousness at set pieces. Mabokgawane always looked shaky, twice misjudging a cross and almost dropping it into his own net, and fumbling Diouf’s header in the lead-up to Mane’s disallowed goal. You have to sympathise with the Bafana Bafana boss Mashaba – after first choice keeper’s Senzo Meyiwa tragic death just weeks ago, he decided Darren Keet would get the number one jersey. But Keet was at fault for at least one, perhaps two of the three goals South Africa conceded against Algeria, and Mashaba has had to call upon Mabokgwane, who just a few months ago was considered fourth choice for the national side. The 27-year-old did make one excellent save, however, pushing away Dame Ndoye’s shot at full stretch as Senegal pushed for a winner. South Africa's Anele Ngcongca (left) challenges Senegal and Southampton's Sadio Man . South Africa's Furman, celebrates their opener against Senegal on Friday . Senegal's Cheikh Mbengue (left) challenges South Africa's Tokelo Rantie in the air . Senegal's defender Mbodji (centre) celebrates after levelling the tie on the hour mark . The result was harsh on South Africa, who played some lovely football before falling to defeat in their first game on Monday, and again showed plenty of one-touch interplay around the box, threatening to create chances. However, actually breaching a well-organised Senegalese backline proved difficult, and Bouna Coundoul was rarely overly stretched in goal. Sibusiso Vilikazi forced Coundoul into a sharp save with a rising drive after a lovely passage of play, and Thabo Matlaba fired just wide from a similar move on the other side, but chances were relatively few and far between. The niggly nature of the game suited Senegal, who carried far more physical presence, particularly in midfield. Doncaster Rovers midfielder, and South Africa captain, Dean Furman was incensed by one tackle in particular, when Lamine Gassama lunged in on Andile Jali, but escaped a booking. And, in the end, it was the extra height and presence that the Senegal side possessed, rather than any particular skill, that could have earned them all three points, Mbodji coming close to his second goal, again with a header from a set piece, in the closing stages.", "reference": "South Africa's hopes of qualifying for quarter-finals hang by a thread .\nOupa' Manyisa's opener was cancelled out by Kara Mbodji of Senegal ."}
{"id": 15336, "article": "Fairhope, Alabama (CNN) -- The polls and the campaign dialogue aren't much help in assessing the Mormon factor in the Alabama and Mississippi primaries. The distinct feeling on the ground was that it had an impact, leading many evangelical Christians to reject pragmatic arguments to ignore Mitt Romney's Mormonism because of his presumed electability. In a pattern dating back to the single-issue campaigns of the segregation era, discussion of this underground religious division was conducted almost entirely through code words and signals and was mainly missing from public forums and press accounts. The strongest signal came from Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who had a political ally reveal election day morning that he was voting for Rick Santorum. The announcement came on the statewide \"Rick and Bubba\" radio show, described by the Birmingham News as having \"broad appeal to evangelical, conservative voters.\" The news flashed around the state long before the polls closed. Everyone understood what was meant by a subsequent Facebook posting by Bentley, who in the last gubernatorial primary rode the church vote to victory over a better qualified Republican opponent. Bentley said he voted for Santorum because he considered him the \"most conservative candidate\" in the field. Among two-thirds of Alabama Republicans, that description translates to most-like-us-religiously. Also on election morning, the president of the Baptist-affiliated University of Mobile, Dr. Mark Foley, addressed religious divisions obliquely in a prominent op-ed piece addressed to \"persons of faith\" in the Mobile Press Register. \"Honest interpretations of scripture\" among Christians \"have formed hard lines that make it hard for us to agree,\" he wrote. He then endorsed Santorum as the best representative of \"American ideals.\" Few people spoke as candidly as a caller to the popular Paul Finebaum radio show. He noted that President Obama was a congregant of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Romney is a Mormon. He concluded \"hold your nose\" and vote for the lesser of two evils. Bloc voting by evangelicals is a standard feature of Southern Republican politics, and polls show it has also fueled Santorum's rise nationally. Belief blog: Romney stumbles in bible belt . Students of the theocratic strain in Southern politics may recall that anti-Catholicism was once a major force in the region's elections. But the fact that both Santorum and Newt Gingrich are Roman Catholic had little impact this time. The South's Republican Christian base vote has been unified since 1980, when Northern urban Catholics and Southern born-agains rallied to Ronald Reagan. Religious or racial prejudice is notoriously hard for pollsters to measure. The National Election Pool found that Gingrich and Santorum together got two-thirds of the evangelical vote in Alabama and Mississippi. Romney got 27% in Alabama and 29% in Mississippi. Those numbers probably reflect the number of establishment Republicans in those states, a group that was notably subdued in the days before the election. Would anti-Mormon feeling in the South hurt Romney in a general election? That's not likely, since about half the Republican voters in Alabama and Mississippi believe Obama is a Muslim. In any event, the Deep South is so much a one-party region that nothing will get the Democratic ticket in the hunt. But in contested states, religion, like race, could be a tilt factor that the press seems reluctant to engage. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion .

Speaking for the first time since his father's anti-gay and racially offensive comments to GQ magazine, Willie, who is the business brains behind the $400 million Duck Dynasty empire, revealed that his controversial father prefers to give Holiday Season partying a miss. Explaining that New Year's Eve isn't a big deal to his dad, Willie said that he was in bed and his wife Korie added that if he was watching anything it would be Fox News. Scroll down to watch... Clean slate: Willie Robertson and his wife Korie appeared on Fox News on New Years Eve to see in 2014 and to put 2013 behind them . Speaking from Colorado, where they are skiing, Willie and his wife steered well clear of any further contentious issues which could cause the recent furore over his father's comments to flare up again. Asked about his father's suspension and subsequent reinstatment by A&E for quoting Biblical passages which compared homosexuality to bestiality, Willie Roberston said that 'A&E and us are fine.' 'We are just glad to be back at work and ready to break in a new year and start making fun shows . 'We are ready to move on and we have all learned a lot.' Indeed, the Robertson family and A&E - which is owned by Disney and the Heast Corporation - have created a merchandising empire worth hundreds of millions since the shows launch in 2012. Asked what 2014 held for the Roberston's, Willie said that the family and their patriarch are looking forward to 'more of the same' and will 'stick together.' During their second exclusive interview with hosts Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer following the ball drop at Times Square, Willie and Korie Robertson were teased about their first kiss of 2014. As the couple indulged the Fox host, country star Luke Bryan photo-bombed the shot and tried to lean in and give Willie Robertson a kiss. 'Let me get a kiss!' Bryan said, grabbing Robertson’s face, but failing to land a smooch. Speaking further about the future of Duck Dynasty, Korie said, 'We’ve been so blessed in 2013 that you know, I think I just hope it continues. We’re going to stick together as a family, and doing what we’re doing, and giving God the glory.' For his part, Willie said, 'Hopefully my employees will keep up with more duck calls while I’m way. Nobody has been putting together duck calls since I’ve been gone. I have to get back and crack the whip.' The son of Phil Robertson concluded by promising, 'I’m going take better care of my beard this year than last year. More lotions and oils. I need to get back to the beard.' New years kiss: Willie and Korie Robertson leaned in for a quick kiss while they appeared on Fox News while the vacationed in Colorado on a skiing holiday . Interruption: Country singer Luke Bryan photo-bombed the shot, and leaned over Korie Robertson to give Willie a near-miss kiss . The Robertson clan are worth an estimated $15 million based of the back of the Duck Commander that Phil launched back in the 1970's . Just last week on the reinstatement of his father to A&E's Duck Dynasty, Willie Robertson took to Twitter to attempt to explain away the family patriarch's coarse views. 'Describing his dad as 'Ole Phil', Willie said that he 'may be a little crude but his heart is good. He's the Real Deal!' And in an exclusive statement to FoxNews on Friday, the family said they were 'excited to keep making a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful support. We will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.' 'The outpouring of support and prayers has encouraged and emboldened us greatly,' the family added. The network said in a statement last week that they planned to reinstate Phil on the reality show after discussions with the Robertson family and consultations with 'numerous advocacy groups'. Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus two weeks ago by A&E in response to the uproar following the GQ magazine interview. But despite consulting advocacy groups, many spoke out against Phil's reinstatement - the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) issuing a statement yesterday to Fox News saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show. Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E . 'Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists. If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people – especially its employees and viewers,' the said. The fourth season is set to premiere this January, and was largely completed before Phil made the statements, meaning he didn't miss a single episode of filming during the ban. The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech. Conservative supporters include Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants’ hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.' Stardom: Two of the unlikely reality TV stars of Duck Dynasty, brothers Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson (left) and Phil Robertson . A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.' Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks. 'While Phil’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “coarse language” he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article. 'He also made it clear he would 'never incite or encourage hate'. We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' read the statement. The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, ' 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. 'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' Strong marriage: Miss Kay and Phil Robertson have been married for 47-years and began dating when she was 14 and he was 18 - they married when he was 20 . Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the \"Duck Dynasty\" TV series, center, leaves the White's Ferry Road Church of Christ in West Monroe, La. on Sunday, Dec. 22, 2013. Robertson was suspended in early December for homophobic comments . He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I’m saying?' GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show. GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe. 'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans - and Americans - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. 'Phil's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.' In addition to his anti-gay rhetoric, the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding Louisiana before the Civil Rights Movement. 'I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field,' said Robertson. 'They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people'—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.'", "reference": "Phil Robertson's son, Willie, appeared on Fox News' New Year's Eve coverage to see in 2014 .\nDeclared that the Robertson clan is extremely keen to move on from the huge row over his father's anti-gay comments .\nRevealed that Phil Robertson would be asleep in bed for midnight as he does not do holiday partying .\nLast week A&E announced Phil Robertson will return to Duck Dynasty .\nRobertson was briefly suspended after making homophobic comments in GQ magazine .\nThe network says it does not endorse Robertson's views .\nFans and Christian conservatives came out in force to support Robertson after the suspension ."}

In the phone call, the Pontiff told refugees at the tent camp in Ankawa, northern Iraq, that they too were like Jesus and were forced to flee because there was no place for them. His call of Christmas greetings came as the Vatican prepared to host the Mass, with the Pope already unveiling a statue of the baby Jesus in a nativity scene. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis swings incense around the statue of the baby Jesus after it was unveiled in St Peter's Basilica earlier this evening . The Pontiff then bent down to kiss the figure of Jesus in the nativity scene as he prepared for the traditional Mass in the Vatican . Before the ceremony, the Pope called Iraqi refugees forced out of their homes by Muslim militants to pass on his Christmas greetings . The Pope carries the statue of the baby Jesus during the Mass, where he said Christmas is a time to remember God's message of peace . Earlier this week, the Pope had written a Christmas letter to the Christians of the Middle East expressing his closeness to them . The Pope told the refugees: 'You're like Jesus on this night, and I bless you and am close to you. 'I embrace you all and wish for you a holy Christmas.' The Ankawa camp houses mostly Christian refugees forced to flee the onslaught by militants of ISIS. In a letter to Middle East Christians penned earlier this week, Francis urged them to remain in the region, where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years, and to help their fellow Muslim citizens present 'a more authentic image of Islam' as a religion of peace. Pope Francis has written a Christmas letter to Christians in the Middle East to express his closeness to them at a time of 'afflictions and tribulations' Pope Francis holds a cross in the late night service in St Peter's Basilica, which marks the start of a busy festive period for the 78-year-old . The Mass came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's' During the Mass hours later in St Peter's, Francis echoed some of the themes he raised in the phone call as he reflected on the Nativity scene. 'How much the world needs tenderness today!' he said. 'God's patience, God's closeness, God's tenderness.' In his homily, the Pope, wearing white vestments, said Christmas is a time to remember that God's message of peace 'is stronger than darkness and corruption'. He said: 'The question put to us simply by the infant's presence is, \"Do I allow God to love me?\" Do we have the courage to welcome with tenderness the difficulties and problems of those who are near to us?' It is the second Christmas season for Pope Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church and being elected last year. The Mass marked the start of a busy few weeks for the 78-year-old that includes New Year's Eve vespers and 2015 greetings a few hours later. On January 6 he will celebrate Epiphany Mass, and on January 11 he will baptise babies in the Sistine Chapel. A day later he gives his annual foreign policy address to diplomats before boarding a plane for a week-long trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Today he focused his concern on those weeping in the world this Christmas, singling out refugees, hostages and others suffering in the Middle East, Africa and Ukraine as he prayed for hope and peace during his traditional Christmas Day message. Anguish for children who are victims of violence, including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school, tempered the pontiff's speech, which he delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.

The service in the Vatican came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's'. Many of the same cardinals, bishops and priests who received the dressing down were on hand in St Peter's Basilica for the Mass. Several have spoken out in recent days saying Francis was merely asking them to examine their consciences, as any Jesuit spiritual director would do, and to use the Christmas season to heal. Meanwhile, thousands of pilgrims also flocked to Bethlehem to travel to the Church of the Nativity for traditional Christmas Eve celebrations. On a crisp sunny day, revellers crowded into Manger Square, stopping in restaurants and admiring the Christmas tree in the town, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Scout troops could be heard playing bagpipes, horns and drums, while street traders sold Santa hats and special sesame sweets for children. A Palestinian worshipper prays in front of candles inside the Church of the Nativity as the world begins to usher in Christmas Day . People gathered together in Manger Square and at the Church of the Nativity in the West Bank city of Bethlehem for Christmas Eve celebrations . Monks hold up the cross as they parade from Jerusalem to Bethlehem outside the Church of Nativity as part of their annual Christmas Eve celebrations . The procession through the town, where Jesus is believed to have been born, was led by Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal, who led Midnight Mass in Bethlehem . The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year, which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer. The Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto that Christians believe is the site of Jesus' birth, was flanked by a towering Christmas tree and a large poster in Arabic and English that read 'All I want for Christmas is justice.' Palestinian tourism minister Rula Maaya said: 'Our message this Christmas is a message of peace like every year, but what we added this year is that all we want from Christmas is justice. Palestinian children dressed up in Santa Claus costumes and masks and played with balloons as part of today's celebrations in Bethlehem .

Another Palestinian boy dressed as Santa Claus enjoys being carried on a man's shoulders while music is played in the background by Scout troops . 'Justice for our people, justice for our case and the right to live like all other people in the world in our independent state without the occupation.' A procession was also led by Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal from his Jerusalem headquarters into Bethlehem, passing through Israel's concrete separation barrier, which surrounds much of the town. Israel built the barrier a decade ago to stop a wave of suicide bombings but Palestinians view the structure as a land grab that has stifled the town's economy. The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year, which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer . Street traders sold Santa Claus hats and masks, and handed out sesame sweets to children where the people began to gather . Mr Twal said he hoped 2015 will be better than the past 'difficult' year. He explained: 'I hope next year there will be no separation wall, and I hope we will have bridges of peace instead.' One of the pilgrims making the trip to the Bethlehem was Irene Adkins from Lorain, Ohio. A Palestinian policewoman hands out flowers to pilgrims in Bethlehem this afternoon as they waited to enter the Church of the Nativity . Visitors lit candles inside the Church of the Nativity, where a gold star embedded on the floor marks the spot where Jesus was believed to have been born . Midnight Mass will take place inside the church later this evening, which is flanked by a towering Christmas tree and a large poster in Arabic and English that reads 'All I want for Christmas is justice' She said: 'My son and I and my husband came for Christmas, to see, you know, be right here where it all took place. It feels wonderful.' Meanwhile Simon Bassett, a British tourist, came to Bethlehem with his wife and three-year-old daughter. He said: 'We're very happy to share Christmas with the Palestinian people and we hope that the peace and joy that comes with Christmas will spread from this place to the whole earth and that the people of all races will learn to live in harmony together.' And as Christmas Day was ushered in around the world, Christians celebrated Mass at churches and cathedrals around the globe. Syrian Christians gather together inside a church in the capital city of Damascus to celebrate Christmas with a traditional Mass . Christians in Iraq also attended Mass at the Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad, left, and also at the Sacred Heart Church in the Iraqi capital, right .

For the lives, millions of lives are lost every day...[in] Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, all these places where innocent lives are being taken every single day. ... So, a life for a life.\" That is what law enforcement say Brown told a police investigator in New Jersey when he was interviewed in July. The U.S. government was doing \"evil\" within its own borders, too, Brown told law enforcement, according to court papers. Brown, a 29-year-old from Seattle, is the prime suspect in a killing spree stretching from New Jersey to Washington state. Between April and June, police say, Brown killed three people in Washington state, allegedly shooting them at close range late at night in quiet locations. Also in June, 19-year-old college student Brendan Tevlin was found inside an SUV in West Orange, New Jersey, dead of multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said. Police say they traced the gun used in all of the killings to Brown. Brown confessed, according to court documents, telling investigators he strictly follows the Muslim faith and had become angry with what he believed the U.S. was doing abroad. Sources tell CNN that Brown was born in the United States and has family in New Jersey. He was convicted of bank fraud in federal court in 2005 and served time in jail. The FBI tried unsuccessfully to link that case to fundraising for terrorists in Africa, said a former FBI official in Seattle. Authorities say one of Brown's co-defendants in that case fled to Somalia to fight with the militant group Al-Shabaab. Officials have not said Brown was motivated by a specific terrorist group, and the killings he's accused of committing happened before the U.S. bombing campaign on ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. \"Based on the statements he made, I believe you could prove that this is a terrorism offense,\" but that doesn't necessarily mean that Brown should be prosecuted in federal court, said Amy Jeffress, a former prosecutor and attorney with Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C. She served two years as chief of the National Security Section in the D.C. Attorney's Office, and oversaw investigations and prosecutions of international and domestic terrorism and espionage.

{"id": 15342, "article": "By . Martyn Halle . A pioneering operation that shrinks the heart without surgery has been carried out in Britain for the first time – and may help thousands of people with heart failure. A drawstring-like device is used to shut off damaged heart tissue. It has given a new lease of life to  the first Briton to undergo the procedure. Before the operation, Sevket Gocer was so breathless he could  not walk. Revolution: How the new non-bypass Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement surgery is carried out . He had suffered two silent heart attacks that caused a large  area of damage to his heart – sending him into heart failure, in which  the heart enlarges and cannot pump effectively. ‘There was very little I could do without having to stop as I was out of breath and exhausted. Just going upstairs at home was an effort,’ says the 58-year-old, who has diabetes. Heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. ‘When people are not able to walk around because their heart is too weak, they are at increased risk of death,’ says Professor of Cardiac Surgery Olaf Wendler, who carried out the operation at King’s College Hospital in London. ‘It is not unusual for a patient to have heart attacks without knowing – and the patient has no idea of the damage caused. They become aware something isn’t right when minor exercises cause breathlessness and simple tasks become difficult. Diabetics are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease, and scarring from heart attacks is one of the main reasons for developing heart failure.’ Important care: Heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the UK . If the heart has been scarred, the damaged area is useless. The conventional operation for heart scarring is to stop the heart and cut out the scarred area while the patient is kept alive on a heart-bypass machine. But this is a risky procedure that doesn’t always produce an improvement. Given Mr Gocer’s frail health, Mr Wendler decided to try the new operation – known as Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement, or LIVE. LIVE can be performed without bypass. It is still necessary to make an incision of 12 to 15cm to open up the chest wall. However, the heart doesn’t have to be cut open. Then, using an X-ray, a needle guides a wire through the left ventricle – one of the heart’s four chambers – and across the scarred area of the heart. The wire is anchored to the walls of the chamber – and then pulled taut to seal off the scarred part of left ventricle. This significantly reduces the size  of the left ventricle, which is the part responsible for pumping blood around the body and which swells and scars during a heart attack. With the scarring sealed off, the ‘resized’ organ is able to pump much more effectively. Mr Gocer, from Bromley, South London, first developed breathing difficulties last year, over several months. He said: ‘My family urged me to get the breathlessness checked and I was referred to King’s by my local hospital. When they scanned me, they could see the scarring and the cardiologist reckoned I’d had two “silent” heart attacks without any pain.’ Before being referred for the procedure this summer, Mr Gocer was worried that he wouldn’t see his two young grandsons grow up. ‘I was told it might give me another ten years, which would be great. No one knows precisely because I’m the first in this country to have had it. But I’m definitely feeling the benefit.’ The hour-long operation is being tested at hospitals across Europe and Mr Wendler believes it could help many thousands of patients. ‘If successful, the operation can bring patients on to an exercise level where they’re able to look after themselves properly, including doing the shopping and having a social life,’ he says. ‘It’s superb that Mr Gocer is doing so well.’ Arsenal fan Mr Gocer had stopped attending football matches because  he ran out of breath walking to the ground. But now he is going again, as well as taking long walks. ‘Last week  I walked over a mile,’ he says. ‘Afterwards I felt fantastic.’", "reference": "Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement can be performed without bypass .\nOp uses a drawstring-like device to shut off damaged heart tissue ."}
{"id": 15343, "article": "If you didn’t get the exam grades you were expecting, blame your parents. Scientists have revealed that the differences in GCSE scores are largely down to DNA. A study of more than 6,500 pairs of twins showed that variations in grades in English, maths and science papers could largely be explained by the mix of genes passed from parents to child. Scroll down for video . Scientists have found that over three fifths of a child’s intelligence is passed down from the parents – much more than previously believed.  Pupils taking their GCSEs are pictured . Some 62 per cent of the difference in scores across the group was down to DNA. The other 38 per cent can be explained by ‘environmental’ factors. This term covers a large range of things from upbringing to health and diet. But while genes – or nature – are more important than nurture, it is not all about intelligence. Many other factors, including personality and behaviour, are also influenced by our genes – and affect exam scores. Even what we think of our teachers, can to some degree be traced back to our genes, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (MUST CREDIT) reports. The researchers, from King’s College London, studied more than 6,500 pairs of twins. The teenagers were given intelligence tests and quizzed on a whole range of subjects including personality traits, behaviour and their self-belief in their ability. This science behind this is complicated but it allows the researchers to work out how important genes are compared to other factors . They were also asked about their attitude towards school and their teachers and whether they perceived their homelife to be chaotic and if their parents gave them enough support with their schoolwork. The researchers then compared the answers of identical twins, who share all their DNA, with those of the non-identical twins, who are no more genetically alike than other siblings. The science behind this is complicated but it allows the researchers to work out how important genes are compared to other factors. They also factored in the children’s GCSE results. The analysis showed genes to be involved in everything from intelligence, to self-belief and a child’s perception of its home and school-life. And that all of these things counted towards exam scores. Researcher Eva Krapohl, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s, says: ‘Previous work has already established that educational achievement is heritable. ‘In this study, we wanted to find out why that is. What our study shows is that the heritability of educational achievement is much more than just intelligence – it is the combination of many traits which are all heritable to different extents. ‘It is important to point out that heritability does not mean that anything is set in stone. It simply means that children differ in how easy and enjoyable they find learning and that much of these differences are influenced by genetics.’ The researchers say children may benefit from more individualised learning – with lessons more tailored towards their needs. It may be that it is also possible to improve exam results by trying to boost a child’s self-confidence or change their perception of how well they are taught or how supportive their parents are. However, they say that the finding that nature is more important than nurture doesn’t mean that teachers aren’t important. For instance, a child would never learn to read without being taught the basics. Researcher Kaili Rimfeld, said: ‘ Finding that educational achievement is heritable certainly does not mean that teachers, parents or schools aren’t important.’ They also say that teenagers shouldn’t use the finding that exam success is largely in their genes to give up. This is because the 62 per cent figure is for differences between children’s scores across the population as a whole. Where any one child is concerned, genes may have a much smaller – or a much larger – influence on how well they do.", "reference": "Over three fifths of a child’s intelligence is passed down from the parents, according to a study by Kings College London .\nStudy of 6,653 pairs of twins suggests IQ really is a product of nature .\nBut the scientists stressed that environment and other inherited traits also play a role in educational success .\nScientists looked at GCSE results to come to their conclusion .\nFindings could influence how subjects are taught at school and back up calls for more personalised learning ."}
{"id": 15344, "article": "Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A leaked video is circulating in cyberspace, showing a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan. The YouTube video shows the same collision that Japanese lawmakers watched on video last week, said legislator Hiroshi Kawauchi, of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan. The Japanese Coast Guard shot the video, which is authentic and not doctored, said Kawauchi, who is a member of the House of Representatives in the Diet, Japan's legislature. \"The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government,\" he added. \"It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government.\" In September, Japan detained the crew of a Chinese fishing boat off disputed islands in the East China Sea. China calls the islands the Diaoyu; Japan calls them the Senkaku. In response to the detainments, China made increasingly aggressive diplomatic threats. Beijing also halted ministerial-level talks with Tokyo, and both sides canceled trips to each other's nations. Japan has since released the fishing crew, who China says were stopped illegally. Japan initially accused the captain of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. But authorities later said that releasing him was in the interest of maintaining relations with China. The crash video that Japanese lawmakers saw has not been released to the public. The video, posted on YouTube, shows what is thought to be the Chinese fishing trawler ramming into a ship, thought to be a Japanese Coast Guard vessel. The Chinese government dismissed the video after Japanese lawmakers saw it, saying it had been edited and that it did not change the ownership of the islands. On Friday, China's Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Cui Tiankai said: \"I think the China-Japanese relationship has to overcome the current difficulties and move forward. This will serve the fundamental interests of both countries. So [we] hope [the] Japanese side will do everything possible to make sure that there's no further disruptions of the relationship.\" The Chinese Embassy in Tokyo has contacted the office of Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan about the leaked video, making an \"official inquiry,\" Kan's office said. No official protest was lodged. Kan's office is investigating the leaking of the video, which has been shown on Japanese television. The man apparently doing the videotaping says on the video that the date is September 7, 2010. That matches the detaining of the fishing crew. The man also says on the video, in Japanese: \"We've ordered them to stop, in Chinese language, but they didn't stop.\" As the Chinese boat approaches, shouting is heard in Japanese. Unidentified voices shout: \"Stop,stop!\" CNN's Jo Ling Kent contributed to this report.", "reference": "The YouTube video is authentic and not doctored, a Japanese legislator says .\nHe calls the leak \"a big mistake for the government\"\nChina has made an \"official inquiry\" with the Japanese prime minister's office .\nKan's office is investigating the leaking of the video ."}

It took six weeks and several failed prototypes before chocolatier John Costello was able to craft the perfect teapot from chocolate. Revealed last week, the chocolate teapot had a large opening at the lid to let the initial waft of steam escape quickly, and a hand-hollowed spout. The manufacturing, by Nestle, took just over two and a half hours. And then it was time for tea. Filmed by a crew from BBC’s The One Show, presenter Marty Jopson poured freshly boiled water into the pot and added a couple of teabags. The good news: it didn’t immediately melt. As the tea brewed for the requisite two minutes. The final brew tasted like tea with a hint of chocolate.

The Honolulu City Council approved a plethora of measures which they hope will lead to a decrease in the numbers of homeless people in areas that are popular with tourists. The most notable of the measures passed includes one that prohibits sitting and lying down on sidewalks in the Waikiki area. Down and out: A homeless man in Honolulu, Hawaii is pictured with his belongings . Contrast: Sunbathers enjoying Waikiki Beach (left) while  a homeless man sleeps near the beach (right) The new bill also prohibits urinating and defecating in public throughout the island of Oahu. The council defended their decision to introduce the legislation as they said the tourism industry had demanded action in relation to safety and human waste concerns. There had been some calls for a ban on sitting and lying down on sidewalks throughout the island but this measure was not passed. Helene 'Sam' Shenkus, marketing director of the Royal Hawaiian Center, told The Associated Press that visitors had 'an expectation' for Waikiki and for Hawaii. She added: 'It's a dream. And because they're families and it's their money, they don't have to come here.' Nowhere to go: Homeless man Jim Trevarthen, 62, watches surfers near Waikiki Beach in Honolulu . Local man Jim Trevarthen was once a surf instructor on Hawaii's renowned Waikiki Beach but now he is one of the many homeless people who are being moved away from Hawaii's renowned tourist areas. Mr Trevarthen suffered the ignominy of homelessness when his landlord increased his rent and cancelled his lease. In stark contrast to his surf instructor days Mr Trevarthen said he now spends his time looking for meals and for places where he can sleep away from the prying eyes of the police who routinely move him on. The reason for a clampdown is the hotel industry is eager to keep Waikiki as an attractive visitor destination, according to Jesse Broder Van Dyke, a spokesman for Mayor Kirk Caldwell. Isolated: A homeless camp is set up near Kiholo Bay in Hawaii . Tourist mecca: Sunset at famous Waikiki Beach, which attracts lots of tourists . Hawaii is a welcoming paradise to the influx of visiting tourists but Mr Trevarthen said him and the other homeless people in the 50th US state are not made to feel so welcome. Mr Van Dyke said they had pushed to make it illegal to sleep on the sidewalks of Waikiki because it was damaging the local tourism industry. He added, 'We've heard from our hotel industry that it's very concerned about keeping Waikiki as an attractive visitor destination.' A proposal has been put forward to move the homeless population to Sand Island, an isolated industrial island and a former internment camp during World War II. Mr Van Dyke said Mayor Caldwell deals with varying complaints from holidaymakers on a weekly basis which relate to threatening behaviour and public urination. Paradise island: A bird's eye view of Waikiki Beach with Diamond Head crater on the right . Mike McCartney, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said Waikiki has seen a significant increase in homeless people who sit and lie on the sidewalks and subsequently restrict tourists from accessing the walkways and businesses. Bishop Stephen Randolph Sykes told mashable.com that sitting and lying on sidewalks had been a Hawaiian tradition since King Kamehameha I, who reigned in the early 19th Century. He encouraged the Hawaiian people to lie by the roadside and he said they should be able to do so without fear of harm. Bishop Sykes said he recognised Waikiki as the economic engine of Hawaii and having their homeless people situated in the vicinity of the area was not something that was beneficial. He added: 'But creating an island-wide type of situation where we're criminalising homelessness is just not \"pono.\" It's not ethical, because these people don't have any place to go, and we're just pushing them around.'

Theresa May has pledged to scrap the Human Rights Act if the Conservatives win the next election . Defiant Theresa May yesterday stepped up her campaign to become Tory leader by confirming her plan for the UK to break free of the shackles of European judges. She also suggested smashing the ‘state monopoly’ of schools and hospitals by letting them make a profit – and demanded a new crackdown on unions. Labour accused the Home Secretary of revealing a ‘secret Right-wing agenda’ to privatise education and the NHS, and to attack unions. And they said quitting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) would backfire. In a speech at Westminster dubbed her personal ‘leadership May-nifesto’, Mrs May said if the Conservatives were to regain popularity, they had to produce ‘radical’ new policies. Her comments reinforce claims by her allies who say she is on course to follow in the footsteps of Britain’s first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Mrs May’s proposal that the UK must consider quitting the ECHR was first revealed by this newspaper last week. Throughout the week, she refused to comment on the matter, as a feud erupted between her Tory supporters and opponents. It also fuelled claims that she is secretly preparing a leadership challenge if David Cameron loses the next General Election, due in 2015. An increasingly confident Mrs May broke her silence at a Tory rally yesterday. It was time to stop criminals getting off scot-free because of human rights laws, she said, declaring: ‘All options – including leaving the ECHR altogether – should be on the table.’ Adopting the mantle of ‘the new Maggie’, Mrs May said it was time to consider boosting standards in education and health by letting schools and hospitals make a profit. Aides denied it amounted to privatisation, pointing out schools and hospitals would continue to be ‘free at the point of use’. Mrs May said the case of hate preacher Abu Qatada, who was denied bail at his latest hearing today, highlighted the need for Britain to change its human rights laws . On quitting the Strasbourg-based . ECHR, Mrs May said: ‘We need to stop human rights legislation . interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration. ‘That’s why the next Conservative Government will scrap the Human Rights Act.’ To cheers from Tory activists, she . continued: ‘We should also consider very carefully our relationship with . the ECHR and the Convention it enforces. ‘When Strasbourg constantly moves the . goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like Abu . Qatada, we have to ask ourselves, to what end are we signatories to the . Convention? Are we really limiting human rights abuses in other . countries? I’m sceptical.’ It undermined Britain’s national interest and its own Supreme Court, the Home Secretary maintained. ‘By 2015 we’ll need a plan for . dealing with the European Court of Human Rights. And yes, I want to be . clear that all options – including leaving the Convention altogether – . should be on the table.’ Similar drastic measures to improve public services should be studied, she said. The Coalition had already given parents and patients more choice but had not gone far enough, Mrs May insisted. Tory MP Peter Bone said that Theresa May's speech 'went down very well' ‘I expect our reform agenda to become . even more radical. Yes, the State should make sure that public services . are  available to all and free at the point of use. ‘Yes, the State should regulate those services to make sure they’re provided everywhere and offer high standards. ‘But too often the State is a poor . provider of services, and its monopoly over the delivery of those . services must end. A future Conservative Government should increase the . number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline . services. ‘If allowing them to make a profit . means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, then we . should consider it with an open mind.’ Mrs May dismissed claims that people ‘don’t want choice, they just want better services’. She said: ‘Why should choice be the preserve of the rich, who can afford to go private? ‘Why is it assumed that wealthy parents and patients are capable of making choices, while nobody else is? ‘It will be left to the Conservatives . to break the state monopoly, to open up public services, and give . everybody – not just the rich – the freedom to choose what is right for . themselves and their families.’ Mrs May also called for new curbs on . unions. She said: ‘It’s not just freedom from the State we need to think . about. We need to think about freedom from vested interests. That means . taking on trade unions resistant to change.’ Last night Tory MP Peter Bone said: . ‘There is no vacancy at the moment but clearly in the future, the Home . Secretary will be a very credible candidate. ‘She has run her department very well . and it’s extraordinarily difficult to be Home Secretary. She has . handled it very well. She has widespread support in the party. ‘Her views on human rights rules and reports that she wants to pull out of the ECHR went down very well with party members.’ By ROBERT VERKAIK, Legal Affairs Editor . A pensions row has broken out between top judges, including Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Government . The wealthiest judges in the country . are using human rights laws to challenge the Government over cuts to . their gold-plated pensions worth hundreds of millions of pounds. A secret dossier leaked to The Mail on Sunday reveals how Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice and . Britain’s most senior judge, is spearheading an unprecedented attack on the Government’s authority over public finances. Judges have instructed top barristers to advise them on using human rights laws to sue Ministers who have reduced pensions in line with those paid to senior civil servants. In the past, judges have not contributed to a pension that pays them half their former salary plus a lump sum pay-off. The changes will result in them contributing for the first time and paying tax on the income the pensions provide. The 100-page dossier exposes the ferocity of the dispute between the Government and the judiciary which could spark a constitutional crisis. In one draft of a letter intended for the Lord Chancellor, Chris  Grayling, the judges use the threat of court action to try to get their way. ‘It would be in nobody’s interest for these issues to be resolved by litigation .  .  . however, you will understand that the possibility of recourse to the courts cannot be ruled out.’ Judges earn up to up £240,000 a year. Lord Judge’s annual pension will be £119,922 and he will get a lump sum payment of more than £250,000 when he retires later this year.Lib Dem MP John Hemming questioned how the case could be properly heard in court. He said: ‘Natural justice requires people do not sit in judgment in their own case. It is difficult to see how an application by the judiciary to quash changes to their own pension payments can be handled without a conflict of interest.’ Neither the senior judiciary nor the Government would comment on the matter.", "reference": "...And fuels leadership speculation with radical 'privatised schools' plan .\nHome Secretary was speaking in front of Tory activists .\nSaid legislation restricts UK's ability 'to fight crime and control immigration'\nCould go further and withdraw from European obligations on rights entirely ."}
{"id": 15352, "article": "Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs has been sentenced to life in military prison with eligibility for parole in 10 years. A military court-martial Thursday found Gibbs guilty of murdering three Afghan civilians, illegally cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as \"souvenirs\" and planting weapons to make the men appear as if they were Taliban fighters killed in legitimate firefights. He was reduced in rank to private and ordered to forfeit all pay and benefits. Whatever sentence Gibbs serves will be reduced by the 547 days he has already spent in prison. \"He said they were all dirty savages,\" prosecutor Maj. Andre Leblanc said at Gibbs' sentencing hearing. \"He is the savage, not the innocent Afghans he murdered. It is monstrous. What kind of savagery does it take to do this? To cut a finger off a victim and show it to people? This is a savage being\" Gibbs' attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, had asked the court for a sentence of life with parole so Gibbs would have the opportunity to be with his now-3-year-old son again. \"He has a long time to reflect on his life, what he has done and what he wants to do in the future,\" Stackhouse said. Gibbs is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue \"kill squad\" that targeted civilians. Another seven soldiers also were charged with lesser crimes including abusing drugs, keeping \"off the books\" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier not to speak out against the platoon's alleged killings. Gibbs had pleaded not guilty. A prosecutor described Gibbs as a \"recruiting poster\" soldier. But the tall, clean-cut Gibbs and the \"kill squad\" he was convicted of leading turned into a public-relations nightmare for the military. \"Sgt. Gibbs had a charisma, he had a 'follow me' personality,\" Maj. Robert Stelle, a prosecutor in the case, told the court in closing arguments Wednesday. \"But it was all a bunch of crap, he had his own mission: murder and depravity.\" The murders Gibbs is accused of committing took place over a period of five months last year, while Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the ArmyÂ¹s 5th Stryker Brigade in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. Gibbs' platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with an Afghan population wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead, prosecutors said Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers allegedly plotted to murder civilians and then planted weapons on them so they appeared to be Taliban attackers. \"Selling a fake engagement as a real engagement, that's what they were doing,\" Stelle told the court. In court testimony, Gibbs said he did not execute anyone. Prosecutors said Gibbs participated in the killings of three unarmed civilians: two farmers and a village cleric. Gibbs said he killed one of the men, but he claimed it was in self-defense. However, the staff sergeant admitted to ripping and cutting off fingers of all three men he was charged with killing. He kept the body parts, he said, to give to soldiers he favored or to intimidate soldiers he disliked. \"I was numb to the situation,\" Gibbs told the court about why he had taken the body parts. \"I wasn't thinking; it's sickening. I am embarrassed.\" Gibbs also admitted to posing for photos with bodies against military regulations. \"People wanted to prove they were there,\" Gibbs replied when asked by his attorney why the soldiers took the photos. The Army later apologized after the photos were leaked to the press. Gibbs appeared shocked after the verdict was read, and his wife, Army Spec. Chelsy Gibbs, began to cry. According to court records, she filed for divorce from Staff Sgt. Gibbs in August and asked for custody of their toddler son. The panel of three officers and two enlisted soldiers started deliberating in a military courtroom near Tacoma shortly before 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) and returned its verdict around 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET). Phillip Stackhouse, Gibbs' defense attorney, had argued other soldiers were framing his client. Three soldiers pleaded guilty to the killings and agreed to testify against Gibbs as part of plea deals. \"What if there is no hard evidence other than what you have heard from that witness stand?\" Stackhouse said Wednesday. Some witnesses also admitted to smoking hashish they obtained from Afghan translators. Their testimony, Stackhouse said, \"came under a cloud of hash.\" Stackhouse argued Gibbs wasn't where other witnesses said he was during the engagements. And, according to Stackhouse, in February 2010 Gibbs couldn't have smuggled an AK-47 in his backpack into a village where prosecutors said he then planted the assault rifle on the body of an Afghan man he had killed. Grasping an AK-47, Stackhouse showed the rifle would not fully fit into a soldier's backpack. Prosecutors countered that Gibbs had used a model of the rifle that has a shorter muzzle and could be concealed. Gibbs remains under investigation for the 2004 shooting death of a family in Iraq during his tour there, Army spokesman Maj. Chris Ophardt told CNN Thursday. The investigation into the family's killing had been closed but was reopened after Gibbs was charged with the murders of civilians in Afghanistan. During testimony last week, Gibbs said he shot at a car that failed to stop at a checkpoint in Iraq that he was manning. Inside the bullet-riddled car, Gibbs testified, were not combatants but an unarmed Iraqi family. Gibbs admitted in court that he told his troops in Afghanistan about the Iraq shooting as an example that soldiers would not face consequences for acting aggressively, even if civilians were hurt. \"If they are put in a tight situation, don't not pull the trigger,\" Gibbs said he advised members of his platoon in Afghanistan. \"You won't go to jail for it.\"", "reference": "Staff Sgt.

{"id": 15353, "article": "More than 500 prisoners escaped when suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives into two Baghdad jails, including the notorious Abu Ghraib, in a well planned military-style assault that left at least 10 police officers and four militants dead. The audacious breakout will underline concerns that experienced Al Qaeda commanders and fighters held in Iraq will now join terrorist groups fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad raising further questions about the decision by Britain and the U.S. to help opposition groups. Maximum security: Abu Ghraib prison, pictured in 2009 following a renovation, was home to some of the world's most dangerous terrorists. (File photo) Officials also warned that it could lead to an increase in the already mounting number of sectarian attacks across Iraq. A surge of violence across Iraq has killed more than 3,000 people since the start of April, and the assaults on the prisons laid bare the degree to which security has eroded in the country in recent months. The increase in bloodshed is intensifying fears of a return to the widespread sectarian killing that pushed the country to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Significantly, The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which was formed earlier this year through a merger between Al Qaeda’s affiliates in Syria and Iraq, said it had carried out the attacks on Abu Ghraib and Taji jails after months of preparation. Monday’s attack came exactly a year after the leader of al Qaeda’s Iraqi branch, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, launched a campaign dubbed 'Breaking the Walls' that made freeing its imprisoned members its top priority. The deadly raid on the high-security jails happened as Sunni Muslim militants are gaining momentum in their insurgency against the Shi’ite-led government that came to power after the U.S. invasion to oust Saddam Hussein. Attacked: As many as 500 inmates - including senior al Qaeda members - are thought to have escaped after terrorists launched a military assault on Abu Ghraib prison. (File photo) Suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives to the gates of the prison on the outskirts of Baghdad and blasted their way into the compound, while gunmen attacked guards with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Other militants took up positions near the main road, fighting off security reinforcements sent from Baghdad as several militants wearing suicide vests entered the prison on foot to help free the inmates. ‘This big security failure shows that the top security commanders have failed to sort out any solutions for the on-going security deterioration,’ said Shawan Mohammed Taha, one of the lawmakers who confirmed the escapes. ‘The terrorists, not the security forces, are now taking the initiative.’ Sunni insurgents, including the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq, have been regaining strength in recent months and striking on an almost daily basis against Shi’ite Muslims and security forces amongst other targets. Caged: Iraqi detainees wait to be released at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad in Iraq - which was the scene of a mass jailbreak by al Qaeda terrorists this morning. (File photo) The violence has raised fears of a return to full-blown conflict in a country where Kurds, Shi’ite and Sunni Muslims have yet to find a stable way of sharing power. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, amateur football matches, shopping areas and cafes where people gather to socialise after breaking their daily fast for the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. Relations between Islam’s two main denominations have been put under further strain from the civil war in Syria, which has drawn in Shi’ite and Sunni fighters from Iraq and beyond to fight against each other. In the city of Mosul, 240 miles north of Baghdad, a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives behind a military convoy in the eastern Kokchali district, killing at least 22 soldiers and three passers-by, police said. Following the attack, leaflets were found near mosques in Mosul signed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Four other policemen, were killed in a separate attack in western Mosul, Iraq’s third-largest city and capital of the Sunni-dominated Nineveh province. Nearly 600 people have been killed in militant attacks across Iraq so far this month, according to violence monitoring group Iraq Body Count.

The U.S. military previously operated the lock-ups in Taji and Abu Ghraib but handed control of both facilities back to Iraqi authorities before the last American troops departed in December 2011. Abuse of prisoners at the hands of American guards inside Abu Ghraib sparked outrage around the world and helped fuel anti-American sentiment in Iraq. Jailbreaks are relatively common in Iraq. A dozen prisoners, including al-Qaida-linked death row inmates, escaped from the Taji prison in January after seizing guards’ weapons. And in September, scores more inmates got away following clashes at a prison in Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit that left 12 people dead.", "reference": "Fears raised that freed inmates may join terror groups in Syria .\nSuicide bombers blasted through high-security gates; gunmen attacked guards with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades .\nTen policemen and four terrorists killed in battle on outskirts of Baghdad .\n500 inmates thought to have escaped before authorities regained control .\nGuards manage to repel simultaneous attack on nearby prison ."}
{"id": 15354, "article": "On Sunday, all contact with AirAsia Flight 8501 was lost over the Java Sea as a wide area of thunderstorms covered the area. The discovery of floating debris on Tuesday about 100 miles from its last known position, in combination with an analysis of ocean currents, will give investigators clues where to search for the remainder of the aircraft. From its cruise altitude, the airplane's gliding distance would also be about 100 miles, but consider that for the debris to drift that same 100 miles it would only take a drift rate of 2 knots, yielding a wide range of possibilities as to the nature of the aircraft's descent to the water below. Many parallels between AirAsia 8501 and Air France 447 in June 2009 are obvious. Both aircraft were lost in thunderstorm areas of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Both crashed at sea where floating debris drifted for days from the point of contact with the sea before being discovered,  and both were sophisticated fly-by-wire Airbus aircraft (though different models). While flying into a thunderstorm is always to be avoided, it was not likely the sole cause of the accident. The reported requests by the crew to deviate course and change altitude seeking to avoided thunderstorm cells and turbulence are completely normal. The weather in the ITCZ has some unique qualities compared to your average thunderstorm over land. The storms are driven by the convergence of airflow patterns between the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth, in addition to the usual factors of warm moist air and unstable atmospheric conditions. The height of the stratosphere --- which tends to put a cap on the height of thunderstorm growth -- averages about 35,000 feet over the mid latitudes (such as that of mainland USA), but reaches to 50,000 feet or more in the ITCZ, providing for the growth of thunderstorms to great heights and accompanying intensity. These features can lead to some unusual conditions such as icing or heavy rain within those storms where it may not normally be expected, as was the case with AF 447 when its airspeed-sensing probes became clogged. In the aftermath of the Air France crash, in addition to an improved design of the probes, significant emphasis has been placed on pilot training on the prevention and recovery from similar scenarios -- such as loss of airspeed indications and high altitude stall recovery. I would say all pilots, especially of Airbus aircraft, would be aware of AF447's lessons, including QZ8501's captain, given his reported experience. There is a recent development however that relates to Airbus A320 series aircraft. A December 10, 2014, Airworthiness Directive (AD 2014-25-51) describes how control of the aircraft could be lost in flight as a consequence of icing of the angle-of-attack probes and an interaction with the airplane's stall protection function. Those probes act like small weather vanes on the side of the aircraft and measure the angle at which the airplane moves through the air -- the angle of attack. If the angle is too high the air can no longer flow smoothly around the wings, resulting in an aerodynamic stall. The acceptable range of angles of attack is fairly small, and gets considerably smaller at higher speeds, such as cruise speed. Simply put, depending on the position of the angle-of-attack probes when freezing occurs and the subsequent speed of the aircraft, the system may be fooled into thinking that the aircraft is approaching a stalled condition -- even when it isn't. In response, the airplane's stall protections pitch the aircraft's nose down to recover. This erroneous pitch down cannot be overridden by the pilots unless an emergency procedure in the Airworthiness Directive is followed. All pilots flying this model airplane should be aware of this. The procedure instructs the pilots to shut down two of the three air data computers to render the usual stall protection inoperative and allow recovery of the aircraft. Of course, there is no way, at this stage of the investigation, to know if this played a part, but investigators will certainly be looking for evidence of this phenomenon. Another obvious question is the apparent lack of transmitted position and altitude data after its last known position in cruise. This data is transmitted throughout the flight by a system known as ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast). This system transmits the airplane's position and other basic data to ground stations. Though its position is GPS-satellite derived, it is not transmitted to satellites, only to ground stations -- so the range to the nearest receiving ground station is a factor in the availability of that data. The apparent sudden loss of this data at cruise could be explained by failures in flight such as an electrical failure, in-flight breakup of the aircraft, or the pilots switching off required data to operate the system such as that outlined in the emergency procedure above. However, it could also be that the aircraft simply flew out of range of the ground stations. Flight tracking websites indicate that this routinely occurs in the general area where QZ8501's last ADS-B transmission was made. I think that is the most likely cause of the end of the data stream and is not necessarily an indication of catastrophic failure in flight. In the case of Air France 447, the aircraft came down in the Atlantic Ocean where the sea depth exceeded 12,000 feet. While some floating wreckage and a number of bodies were discovered within a few days on the surface, the extreme depth and rough terrain on the ocean bottom delayed discovery of the remainder of the aircraft and recovery of the flight recorders for two years. Fortunately, the 100-foot depth of the Java Sea in the area where evidence of QZ8501 was found will almost certainly result in the relatively rapid location of the aircraft and recovery of the two flight recorders. Consideration of ocean currents during the two days between the aircraft's disappearance and the discovery of floating debris will help lead investigators to find the remainder of the aircraft and its passengers. We should not be subjected to long period of uncertainty such as with AF447 -- or the continuing lack of information on MH370. While any accident investigation will take months to complete, I would expect more information to be available as the search and recovery continues. Clues from the way in which airplane parts were damaged on impact and the flight data and voice recorder contents will provide answers. But like any aircraft accident, the cause is likely to be the result of a chain of events and conditions, the absence of any one of which would have avoided this tragic accident. At this time, we can only guess what some of those events and conditions are.", "reference": "Bill Palmer: AirAsia crash bears similarities in terms of weather, other factors, to AF447 .\nHe says storms in the Intertropical Convergence Zone can grow to great height, intensity .\nPalmer: Real causes won't be known until more of the plane is recovered, analyzed ."}

The domain name company released the advert on Tuesday - five days before it will be viewed by more than 100 million people during the Patriots and Seahawks game - and it was met with outrage. The advert opens with the golden retriever puppy  riding in the back of a truck, as it parodies Budweiser's commercials featuring a dog and its Clydesdale horses. But instead of enjoying the view, Buddy is thrown from the bed of the truck and he faces a treacherous journey home across train tracks and bridges and through mud and rain. Don't be fooled: GoDaddy's 2015 Super Bowl advert, which was revealed on Tuesday, opens with Buddy the puppy looking out from the bed of a truck - but it soon takes a dark turn . Plot twist: The truck hits a rock and the golden retriever puppy is thrown from the back of the truck . Finally, he sees his owners' farm and runs towards them, as they open their arms in joy. But it's no happy ending: the only reason they're glad to seem him is because they've sold him on a website they set up with the help of GoDaddy. The pup is promptly put in a van and driven away by GoDaddy spokesperson Danica Patrick. When the advert was revealed on the Today show on Tuesday morning, the hosts were shocked. 'Me no likey,' Natalie Morales said as her co-hosts sat in silence. Savannah Gurthie added: 'I don't know how people are going to feel about that.' 'Oh, I know how they're going to feel about it,' Matt Lauer said. Viewers of the video have responded with shock and disgust. On track: Buddy, who was nine-weeks-old when they shot the commercial, tries to find his way home . Treacherous: In other scenes, he cowers in the cold as he tries to get back to his family's farm . 'Poking fun at a puppy mill is not a laughing matter,' wrote Mick Magnuson. 'And I hope they get bombarded with calls and emails letting them know how disgusting the commercial is.' 'What kind of monster do they have running their marketing department? #GoDaddyPuppy Tasteless, horrid, shameful,' Kate Thomas tweeted. Some customers even messaged the domain service to say they would no longer be registering websites with them again. But some saw the funny side. 'My first thought was, this isn't funny, but it got so weird I couldn't not laugh! Funny commercial,' Darren McPhee wrote on Twitter.

The striker, knowing he was about to be taken off by manager Brendan Rodgers following a poor 45 minutes, decided to grab himself a wearable souvenir a little earlier than is custom. But although his actions attracted widespread criticism, it is by no means the first time two players have decided to swap shirts at half-time. We take a look back at some of the other occasions when shirts have been swapped prematurely. Mario Balotelli and Pepe chat as they leave the field at half-time during the Real Madrid vs Liverpool clash . The pair then decided to swap shirts as they walked down the tunnel at half-time . Andre Santos and Robin Van Persie . Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal - November 4, 2012 . Andre Santos ran after his former team-mate and asked to swap shirts as the players headed down the Old Trafford tunnel. Van Persie had just joined United for £24m and had scored after just three minutes of this match. Santos was privately reprimanded by manager Arsene Wenger but claimed the half-time swapping of shirts is a custom in Brazil.

Terrorists are still in control of parts of the BP plant where a disastrous rescue attempt ended with the deaths of 30 hostages, including at least two Britons. The SAS is on standby to rescue survivors but the Algerian government has rejected five offers of help from David Cameron. Members of the special forces are already in Algeria to advise the local military and help catch Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the terror chief behind the attack. Scroll down for video . Mastermind: Militant militia leader Moktar Belmoktar will have a bounty of $1million on his head . The Amenas gas field in Algeria is seen in this satellite image courtesy of Google Earth . An SAS unit has been sent to Cyprus in preparation. It is feared Belmokhtar’s men are holding British and American hostages and captives from other countries. In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cameron expressed frustration at the Algerian handling of the crisis and failure to accept help. ‘I was disappointed not to have been informed of the assault in advance,’ he said. ‘I offered UK technical and intelligence support – including from experts in hostage negotiation and rescue – to help find a successful resolution.’ Of the SAS, Mr Cameron said: ‘They are on standby, hostage-negotiating experts and other sorts of technical expertise that we can provide.’ The Prime Minister said Britain would help lead a ‘robust security response’ to the crisis and ‘will do everything we can to hunt the people down who were responsible’. Lucky: Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Youcef Yousfi (centre) visits an injured hostage at a clinic - 10 UK hostages are still thought to be held captive . Rescued: One of the rescued workers speaks with Yousfi. David Cameron will be hoping to be in a similar position with the UK captives in the future . He held talks with US defence secretary Leon Panetta in Downing Street yesterday to coordinate an intelligence effort to locate Belmokhtar who is dubbed the Marlboro Man because he raises funds for terrorist atrocities by smuggling cigarettes. Mr Panetta said that the terror gang ‘will have no place to hide’. A bounty on the Blood Battalion leader’s head – currently $100,000 – is expected to be put up to $1million – around £700,000. Mr Cameron yesterday chaired two meetings of the Cobra crisis committee and spoke twice to his Algerian counterpart Abdelmalek Sellal, their fourth and fifth conversations since the terrorists struck on Wednesday. The Foreign Office flew some victims of the crisis home yesterday and sent a crisis response team to Algiers. MI6 officers and Metropolitan Police hostage negotiators were travelling to the scene last night. The Algerian government said that 98 out of 132 foreign hostages held were safe, leaving 34 unaccounted for. But some reports put the number missing as high as 60. Anger: Prime Minister David Cameron has spoke of his disappointment at the way the Algeria crisis has been dealt with so far as he prepares to send the SAS in . Hunt is on: U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has pledged that Belmokhtar will 'have no place to hide' Freed hostages revealed yesterday how Algerian forces had launched their attack on the heavily armed militants with a blitz from helicopters on five jeeps carrying foreign workers and their abductors. Four of the jeeps suffered direct hits – one is said to have burst into flames and another was blown several feet into the air. There were few survivors and witnesses said bodies were ‘everywhere’. But as a fierce gun battle broke out, the fifth jeep crashed allowing some of those held with explosives belts around them to make a break for freedom. The Secret Intelligence Service and MI5 are also examining the possibility that one of the terrorists is British after reports that a man speaking impeccable English was among the hostage takers. Many of the foreign workers hid throughout the drama – three Britons climbed into the ceiling of a canteen – to evade the terrorists as they searched for more captives. Questions: The attack suggests either a lapse in stringent security at the base, or an emboldening of Islamist insurgents . Remote: The In Salah gas project is located in the Sahara desert in Algeria. Although the desert complex was heavily guarded, it is vulnerable to attack due its lone proximity . Last night seven military helicopters were said to be searching in the desert with floodlights while making appeals to terrified gas workers they believe are still in hiding. Algeria claimed their special forces had captured one terrorist alive and he said the group were 32 strong and under the command of Belmokhtar. It was claimed last night that a video from Belmokhtar would be released in which he would offer to free American hostages in exchange for Egyptian Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and Pakistani Aafia Siddiqui. Both are in jail in the US on terrorism charges. Belmokhtar also apparently calls on the French and Algerians to negotiate an end to the war in northern Mali. MI6, GCHQ and the CIA have all been tasked with finding Belmokhtar. GCHQ and the American NSA listening stations will use satellite and electronic surveillance and voice match software to locate him. That would pave the way for a drone strike on his hideout. Looking forward: Four British workers, including the man on the right, called Darren Matthew, who have escaped the Algerian refinery taken over by Al Qaeda have spoken for the first time about their ordeal .", "reference": "Thirty hostages, including at least two Britons, believed to have been killed .\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron highly critical of Algerian counter-efforts .\nBounty on man behind the attack, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, will rise to $1million .\nU.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta says the terror gang will 'have no place to hide'"}
{"id": 15358, "article": "Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Uganda said that it had been warned of a \"specific threat\" Thursday evening against Entebbe International Airport near the Ugandan capital, Kampala. An embassy statement, which said the warning came from Ugandan police, based on intelligence sources, said the threat involved an unknown terrorist group. \"Individuals planning travel through the airport this evening may want to review their plans in light of this information,\" it said. The warning comes a day after the Obama administration said it was stepping up security for some flights headed to the United States from Europe and the Middle East, reflecting heightened concern that terrorists are developing more sophisticated bombs designed to avoid airport screening. Specific steps and airports were not disclosed. A homeland security official said the Transportation Security Administration would work with airlines and security agencies overseas and that the changes would primarily focus on airports in Europe and the Middle East. The effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights. But passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics, additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives, and another stage of screening at boarding gates, in some cases, the official said. The changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect, the official told CNN. There was no specific plot. Earlier this week, CNN reported the United States was considering new airport security measures because of concerns that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was working on undetectable explosives. Tighter security ordered for some U.S.-bound flights . Streets awash with troops . Security was stepped up Thursday on the road to Entebbe, some 26 miles (42 kilometers) outside the capital and the country's only international airport. Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesman Patrick Onyango said the heightened police presence, backed up by the army, was in response to the potential airport terror threat as well as security concerns around the soccer World Cup and international events taking place in Uganda. Departing travelers appeared to undergo detailed screening by anti-terrorism police and other security agents as they entered Entebbe airport; while those arriving said the security process took longer than usual. \"It is unusual out there,\" said Jonathan Kikonde, an engineer and regular traveler through Entebbe who arrived at lunchtime. \"We have been subjected to a screening of both the body and luggage.\" Residents also saw a heightened military and police presence Thursday on Lake Victoria, on whose shores the airport sits. \"We have been told by police authorities that terrorists are capable of targeting them at the crowded fish landing sites and piers for ferries and boats that transport people to the islands,\" said Bruhan Kyeswa, a fishmonger at Nkiwogo landing site, the nearest to Entebbe airport. In Kampala itself, the streets were awash with heavily armed troops, their presence concentrated around busy points like malls, bus stations and markets. Kampala Metropolitan Police commander Felix Kaweesi said by phone: \"We have got information from cross-border security that terrorists are already here (in Uganda) building cells.\" The U.S. Embassy in Uganda reminded U.S. citizens of \"the continued threat of potential terrorist attacks in the country,\" particularly in crowded public places such as hotels, restaurants, malls and transportation hubs. 'As few disruptions' as possible . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement Wednesday that he had directed the TSA to \"implement enhanced security measures in the coming days\" at selected overseas airports. \"We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible,\" Johnson said. The measures do not involve U.S. domestic flights, and passengers could see changes as early as next week. The UK Department for Transport confirmed Wednesday that it is also stepping up some of its aviation security measures. It said that most passengers should not experience \"significant disruption.\" Since hardening cockpit doors and taking other measures after the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks, the U.S. aviation security focus has shifted primarily from hijackings to plastic and other explosives that can be carried aboard a plane or hidden in baggage. The United States has particularly been focused on efforts by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to develop undetectable explosives since the unsuccessful attempt by the so-called underwear bomber to bring down a Delta Air Lines jet over Detroit in 2009. Journalist Samson Ntale reported from Kampala, while CNN's Barbara Starr reported from Washington and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

{"id": 15359, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court displayed some discomfort on Wednesday as it tried to resolve a testy international custody fight. Deep divisions were apparent from the bench, as the justices tried to sort out competing allegations raised by the parents and proper legal remedies. At issue is whether an appeal of an American judge's order allowing a child to go back to Scotland with the mother becomes moot under the terms of an international treaty since the child is no longer in the United States. Lynne Chafin and her lawyers say the purpose of the Hague Convention treaty was to stop children like her 5-year-old daughter, Eris, from bouncing back and forth between countries over custody. But the girl's father, Jeffrey Chafin, says the custody fight began in American courts where the girl was living at the time, and that his legal claims were never fully heard in those federal courts. A majority on the high court appeared to offer some level of support to the father's legal position, during a tense hour of oral arguments. The word \"unfortunate\" was mentioned several times by the justices over the entire \"he-said, she-said\" parental disagreements. \"The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial, or the parent with control over the child, to leave immediately,\" Chief Justice John Roberts told the mother's lawyer. \"Even after a motion for a stay has been filed. Get on the first plane out and then you're home free. That seems to me to be a very unfortunate result.\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to the father's lawyer that the purpose of the international treaty was to eliminate \"shuttling of children\" across courts in different nations, a process she said could take years. An eventual ruling in the case of Chafin v. Chafin could establish an important precedent on the discretion of U.S. courts to decide where children caught in custody fights should stay. In the middle of this case is Eris, who now resides in a remote part of the United Kingdom with her mother. Army Sgt. Jeff Chafin is based at Ft. Stewart, Georgia. He claims she is an unfit mother. She was once arrested for disorderly conduct after a night of drinking and was deported for overstaying her visa. She claims he is manipulative. Back in her home country without her daughter, Lynne filed a \"Petition for Return of Child to Scotland\" under the 1980 Hague Convention's Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It grants parents in general a \"right of custody\" and a separate \"right of access,\" ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others. More than 80 nations are a party to the treaty, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Lynne did not see her daughter for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in Alabama. Just hours after a federal judge allowed Lynne to take the child to Scotland, the two were on an overseas flight. A federal appeals court later said the matter was out of its hands since the child was now in another country, ruling the issue was moot. Both sides disagree on whether the father moved quickly enough to appeal the immediate removal order in an appropriate court. Now the justices will decide the jurisdictional questions. Michael Manely, the father's attorney, told the justices that the issue was not moot and that the child should be brought back to the United States while courts here resolve the matter. \"When you say bring the child back, there's an impediment to that because now this court in Scotland has told her don't-- the child stays here,\" said Ginsburg. \"There's an order that the child not be removed from Scotland.\" Tougher questions were aimed at Stephen Cullen, attorney for Lynne Chafin, who said \"once the doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in Scotland, unless the plane turns round and comes back again, it is all over\" on any appeals. \"You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those contracting treaty parties are breaching the convention, are you?\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor skeptically. Roberts -- the only justice with young children -- suggested the father was not given a proper time or opportunity to appeal once the initial removal order was signed by the federal judge in Alabama. \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal. And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the benefit of that.\" Justice Stephen Breyer said just because the child is in Scotland, does not mean federal courts in the United States still have no role to play. \"I don't understand why you want a treaty where the best interests of the child are what's at issue, and then you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child where you have parents from both nations pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying.\" Jeff Chafin was in the courtroom for the morning arguments, dressed in his Army dress uniform. \"I told my little girl I would do everything I could to get her,\" Sgt. Chafin told CNN National Correspondent Joe Johns this week, \"to make sure she's safe.\" He last visited the girl overseas a few weeks ago. \"I don't believe that (the current legal fight) is in the best interest of the child as it's going to go on for years and years to come,\" Lynne Hales Chafin told CNN. A ruling is due in a few months. The case is Chafin v. Chafin (11-1347).", "reference": "Case involves girl living with mother in Scotland; husband is in U.S.\nCustody case tests bounds of international treaty over custody rights .\nAn eventual ruling could establish an important precedent ."}

Here, Sportsmail gives you Rodgers' Anfield career in quotes... Brendan Rodgers' quotes and proverbs have become legendary, but not always for the right reasons . 2012-13 . 'It's not just about training players, it's about educating players. You train dogs.' 'I will leave no stone unturned in my quest - and that quest will be relentless.' 'That's the problem with being a manager - it's like trying to build an aircraft while it is flying.' 'It (the documentary Being Liverpool) was something I didn't watch, and thankfully it's over.' 'I think there are three players who will let us down this year - the cause, the fight, everything - and I have written them down already in these three envelopes.

'I use a quote with the players, \"Per aspera as astra\", which is Latin for \"Through adversity to the stars\".' On Luis Suarez: 'He's a good guy.' He also said: 'He's so clever.' 'I've always said that you can live without water for many days, but you can't live for a second without hope.' 'I always say a squad is like a good meal. I'm not a great cook, but a good meal takes a wee bit of time. But also, to offer a good meal you need good ingredients.' 'I believe a young man will run through a barbed-wire fence for you. An older player looks for a hole in the fence.' Rodgers described Luis Suarez as really clever and a good guy, some footbalelrs may disagree . 'I've always worked along the statistic, that if you can dominate the game with the ball you have a 79 per cent chance of winning a game of football.' 'When we have the football everybody's a player. The difference with us is that when we have the ball we play with 11 men, other teams play with 10 and a goalkeeper.' 2013-14 . On his speech about envelopes: 'There never were any names.' 'When we lost at Stoke last season I got home on Boxing Day night and family and guests were all around the house. I went straight upstairs to my room and didn't come out.' Rodgers said that Tottenham should be challenging for the title considering the money they spent in 2013 . 'Look at Tottenham. If you spend more than £100million, you expect to be challenging for the league.' (Liverpool spent £113m in the summer of 2014) 2014-15 . 'They don't have to sell. (Southampton) have a choice. Maybe Southampton's objectives have changed. They were looking to be a Champions League club, I believe. 'It's the nature of it. The players will want to compete at the highest level they possibly can.' 'Lots of players are really impressed by what we are doing as a club and really excited about coming to Liverpool.' 'The last 18 months we have been on a magic carpet ride of development but we still have a lot of growth to make. 'We obviously lost a world-class player but our challenge now is to progress.

Prosecutors said Thursday they have changed their minds about reducing charges against an undercover police detective accused of taking part in a motorcyclists-versus-SUV driver melee that was caught on video. The Manhattan district attorney's office had said in December that the SUV driver's facial injuries were healing and might not warrant the first-degree assault and gang assault charges against Detective Wojciech Braszczok and nine other bikers. The charges require permanent disfigurement. 'Unfortunately, it appears the victim's injuries have not healed as well as we initially believed they would,' so the charges stand for now, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said Thursday. Scroll down for video . Alexian Lien was horrifically beaten in front of his terrified wife and daughter after he was mobbed by a members of a biker gang last September . Wojciech Braszczok (center) conceals his face as he walks into court in November. Braszczok, an undercover NYPD detective, is charged with assault and gang assault - both in the first-degree . Defense lawyer John Arlia told a judge the developments meant \"the game will change\" in the case, which grabbed headlines last fall as a highway horror. Arlia and fellow Braszczok lawyer Bruce Wenger declined to comment after court. Braszczok - who walked through the courthouse hallway with a hood up and a scarf covering most of his face to shield himself from photographers - has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers have said that he never came close to the SUV driver and that the video footage will exonerate him. The other nine motorcyclists have court dates Friday. The DA's office declined to comment on whether their charges would also remain the same, but they are based on the same injuries. A spokesman for the SUV driver, Alexian Lien, had no immediate comment Thursday. Lien hasn't been charged, and he has filed a legal notice saying he plans to sue the city over Braszczok's role in the September 29 confrontation. The tension began when an SUV carrying a family on a Sunday drive crossed paths with a motorcycle rally - with at least one rider capturing events on a helmet-mounted camera and later posting video online.

Police say a motorcycle slowed in front of the Range Rover, which then bumped the bike. Motorcyclists dismounted and converged on the SUV.

The off-duty Braszczok wasn't accused of hitting Lien. But prosecutors have said he shattered the SUV's back window and did nothing to end the assault or get help. The 10-year police veteran told authorities and his union that he didn't intervene partly because he works undercover. Crushed by the SUV, Mieses suffered broken legs and severe spine injuries.

The immigrant population of the capital will reach at least five million in 16 years - having more than doubled from one million in 1971 to three million in 2011, when the last census was carried out. New research has found the rise of non-British born Londoners will take the city's total population to more than 10 million in 2031 and 11 million in 2041 - compared with the 8.6 million living there today. But while the city's immigrant population will continue to rise sharply in the coming decades, the number of British-born people will continue to slowly decline. In 1971 this figure was at more than six million but this is likely to sink below five million in the coming decades. Tipping point: New research has revealed that the immigrant population of London will reach at least five million in 16 years - and outnumber British-born residents . Immigration groups have said that the situation will be 'totally unacceptable' to many voters while political parties say it will but put even more pressure on public services. Vice chairman of MigrationWatch UK Alp Mehmet said: 'The public understand the enormous effect that the present rate of immigration is having on many of our cities and especially on London.

'It is time that the political class woke up to the implications for the future of our society before they find their credibility in shreds.' Research by The Times has revealed the likely change in London's population by 2031 and used previous studies. According to the national census from 2011 the capital's population was 8.2 million, up from 7.5million in 1971.

Matthew Todd Miller was convicted of committing \"acts hostile\" to North Korea and sentenced to six years of hard labor last week. Saturday's report in the state-run Korean Central News Agency boldly heaped blame on Miller, claiming his acts were a preconceived plan to gain notoriety. The 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California, arrived in North Korea as a tourist in April. After his arrival, he tore his visa at  Pyongyang's airport and  shouted his desire to seek asylum, according to KCNA. 'Rudely behaved' State media described him as \"rudely behaved,\" saying he was sent to infiltrate prison as part of a United States campaign against  North Korea. \"He perpetrated the above-said acts in the hope of becoming a world famous guy and the second Snowden through intentional hooliganism,\" state media said. Edward Snowden got asylum from Russia, where he fled last year after leaking classified U.S. government  documents. Once sentenced, Miller hoped to meet  Kenneth Bae, another American detained in North Korea. He planned to secure Bae's release so both can serve as \"witnesses\" to the human rights violations in the nation, state media said. \"The crime committed by Miller Matthew Todd was prompted by his sinister political aim to deliberately slander the DPRK,\" it said. DPRK refers to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Its government is a communist dictatorship renowned for human rights abuses. Washington demands release . The  U.S. State Department has demanded that North Korea release Miller and Bae, and American Jeffrey Fowle. Fowle, 56, was arrested in June while traveling as a tourist. Bae, who was detained in 2012, has been accused of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. He was moved from a hospital to a labor camp. Miller talks to CNN . Earlier this month, Miller told CNN's Will Ripley that he \"prepared to violate the law of DPRK before coming here. And I deliberately committed my crime.\" But Miller didn't elaborate on what his \"crime\" was. He said he wouldn't learn of his charges until he went to trial. It's unclear whether his statements were made freely or under coercion. First stop was South Korea . Miller's family lives in Bakersfield, and he is a 2008 graduate of Bakersfield High School, according to CNN affiliate KBAK. In a July interview, a neighbor told The Associated Press that Miller went to South Korea about four years ago to visit his brother and started teaching English. He traveled to North Korea this year after arranging a private tour through the U.S.-based company Uri Tours, which takes tourists into North Korea. Uri Tours has said it doesn't have \"any understanding of why\" Miller ripped up his visa. The company offers tours despite U.S. State Department warnings about arbitrary arrest and detention in North Korea.", "reference": "State media: Matthew Todd Miller wanted to become \"a world famous guy\"\nAfter his arrival, he tore his visa, it says .\nHe also shouted his desire to seek asylum, according to state-run KCNA ."}

After the sordid incident, remains of the victim's body were also found strewn around Schneider's home, wrapped in baking foil and paper. Michael Schneider, 45, has been jailed for four years after the Berlin regional Court heard he sliced up bank clerk Carsten Schmidt, 37, before cooking his head in a stewpot . Now Schneider has now been jailed for less than four years, after being found guilty of bodily harm resulting in death.

During the hearing at the Berlin Regional Court, the court heard how the victim had invited Schneider to his apartment in Marienfelde, south Berlin, for sex in January 2012. In court, the defence claimed Schmidt asked the defendant to tie him to the bed and cover his mouth and nose with tape. The victim then died of suffocation, the court was told. It was then that Schneider cut up Schmidt's corpse. Schmidt, who was openly gay, was due to go on to a party that evening with his friend. When he did not show up, the friend alerted police.

{"id": 15370, "article": "Did President Barack Obama do the right thing when he agreed to trade Taliban leaders in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl? The issue has become a weapon in the partisan political arsenal and it will surely join the Benghazi incident in election season. And yet, the Bergdahl deal is something quite different. When Obama approved the release of dangerous, top-value Guantanamo prisoners in exchange for an American soldier captured under mysterious circumstances, he negotiated a tangle of competing moral principles. If it were possible to wrestle with these issues in a nonpartisan way, the country might gain from this difficult experience. The Bergdahl-Taliban trade will be discussed in ethics classes for years to come. Here are some of the hard questions: . 1) America holds two principles high on its moral agenda. First, the U.S. does not leave any of its soldiers behind in the battlefield. Second, the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. But what happens when the two principles collide? Which matters more? Obama has made his position clear: \"We don't leave men and women in uniform behind.\" The administration argues it did not negotiate with terrorists. And although the United States does not classify the Taliban as a terrorist organization, the Taliban, including those released in the deal, have worked with al Qaeda and have had a major role in killing thousands of civilians. Khirulla Khairkhwa, for example, according to secret U.S. documents released by WikiLeaks, was \"directly associated\" with Osama bin Laden. Mohammad Fazl, according to Human Rights Watch, presided over the killing of thousands of Shiite Muslims. A transaction that frees members of a shadowy organization lends the group prestige. It invigorates it and sends the message that taking prisoners ultimately pays. The U.S. broke one of its rules. But it had to. The two rules were mutually exclusive. The U.S. had to break one in choosing a path through this moral dilemma. 2) Does the rule of \"leave no one behind\" apply to deserters? We don't know much about how Bergdahl came to become a prisoner. But many of his comrades in the field say Bergdahl walked away from his post by choice. He reportedly emailed his father before leaving, \"The future is too good to waste on lies\" and left a note in his tent saying he was leaving, according to The New York Times. Soldiers say six Americans died trying to find him after he left. If that is true, does the \"leave no one\" rule still apply to him? Obama says: \"We still get an American soldier back if he is held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don't condition that.\" It's an unsettling decision, particularly for the relatives of those who may have died trying to save him. But the rule sends a message to other American soldiers that their country takes this solemn commitment very seriously. If Bergdahl is a deserter, he should face justice on that count. If his desertion caused America such an awful price, he -- and the country -- will have to live with that. 3) Does the life of one man we know warrant losing the lives of many whom we don't know? There is an ugly truth hanging over any prisoner exchange with an active enemy: It saves one life, but it is likely to cost many more. If the trade were a simple mathematical calculation, it would make no sense. The U.S. says 17%, perhaps as many as 29%, of those released from Guantanamo Bay have turned to terrorism. The predicament is familiar to Israel, which has released thousands of convicted prisoners in lopsided trades for a handful of Israelis, even for the bodies of Israelis killed by their captors. The decision is wrenching even when the soldier gaining his freedom was captured through no fault of his own. In 2011, Israel traded 1,027 Palestinians, including many convicted in terrorist attacks that killed scores of civilians, in exchange for Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for five years. By then, Israeli statistics already showed that terrorists freed in exchange for 19 Israelis over the years had gone on to kill 182 more. Still, they went ahead with the deal, and the public supported it. Shalit had become an Israeli icon, everyone's child. But the fact is that one person, with a name, a family, a face, somehow takes more value than other nameless ones who may die later as the result of the trade. 4) If a person should be saved, what cost is too high? Is there a limit? Just how much is one American soldier worth? As far as we know, the deal with Bergdahl brought five of the top Taliban leaders to freedom -- although they are supposed to remain in Qatar for one year. Other countries have paid large amounts of cash as ransom to free their citizens. The price is not only the amount exchanged at the moment of the trade. It is also what happens with that currency whether it's people or money. Unrest in parts of North Africa, which has left hundreds, perhaps thousands dead, was financed in part by ransom money paid by various governments. 5) If a prisoner exchange is politically costly but morally correct, should a politician support it? Obama must have known there would be political fallout. He made his decision. Hillary Clinton, too, is lending measured support to the trade. None of these is an easy question. Each country answers them in the light of its own values and priorities. America would do well to examine them in a nonpolitical way, as a crafting of the nation's beliefs, and a guide for making moral choices in the future.

Mujahid almost never gives TV interviews and he initially said the interview with CNN would last 15 minutes, but spoke to Robertson for 45. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: Can you tell me what the Taliban strategy is in Afghanistan? Zabiullah Mujahid: The policy is quite clear. We ask from the beginning and we say once again to enforce the sharia law and Islamic government in Afghanistan, to remove foreign forces from our country. This is our country; we have to govern it. CNN: Do you want to take over the government in Kabul or do you want to work with others? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly when we rose up in Afghanistan in 1994 we did not rise up to be the government ... you know the mujahadeen government ... and when the Russians flee Afghanistan. But the mujahadeen were fighting each other, the people were being killed. So we rose up not for power and government we rose up just ... to force Islamic law and to help our widows in Afghanistan. We did jihad for the Islamic government. And No. 2 I want to tell you clearly our Afghan nation is held hostage by foreign troops. We don't fight the government. We fight for the sake of our country, for the sake of our nation, for Islamic law and also to rescue our country from the crusader . CNN: There are going to be elections in Afghanistan this year. Does the Taliban support those elections? Mujahid: First I want to tell you this is not an election, it is selection. People are selected from the White House. This is just a joke and we ask from our Muslim brothers and our population not to take part in this election because this is people selected from the White House before the election. CNN: Will you try to stop the elections? Mujahid: We announce clearly from the beginning for our Muslim brothers not to take part in this election. We want to disturb this election; it is not the election of the Afghan nation. It is not the will of the Afghan nation. I told you clearly it is what the U.S. wants in Afghanistan, and yesterday as announced by our leader Mullah brother we will target the Afghan parliamentary members and government officials so if there are elections yes it is clear we will target them. CNN: And will you target them using suicide bombs? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly we have different kinds of tactics. One of them yes is suicide attack. We will not target everyone with a suicide attack. We will see the place. Yes the suicide attack is part of our war with the crusader so when we need a suicide attack we will do the suicide attack. When we need a target attack we will do a target attack, when we need the bomb blast we will do the bomb blast. Where there is the combat war, we will do it in that place. According to the situation we will do the things that work. CNN: What is your policy toward Afghan civilians? Mujahid: First we give the proof from the beginning of our jihad against crusader we do not want to kill civilians. We sacrifice ourselves for the safety of the civilians; we never want to kill the civilians. Also we ask of the civilians don't be close to the troops, be away from them not to be targeted. CNN: How do you justify suicide bombs? Mujahid: This is from the history of Islam from the days of Prophet Mohammed, from the history of those days. They sacrificed some people, friends of Mohammed, for the sake of Islam. This is part of the jihad and part of the fighting. We will fight them and we will target them. CNN: Are the Taliban in Afghanistan supporting the Taliban in Pakistan with their fight? Mujahid: We do not want to interfere in the Pakistan Taliban affairs. We are Afghan Taliban and our policy is clear against the foreign troops. The second thing -- yes there are sympathies between the two sides. CNN: Do the Pakistan Taliban come to Afghanistan and help you in your fight? Mujahid: I ask you do only Americans come to Afghanistan or are there 40 other countries with them? So we are Muslims. If they come, we will say welcome to them -- our Muslim brothers in the Pakistani Taliban. CNN: President Obama is sending 20,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Will that defeat your forces, the Taliban? Mujahid: I will clearly tell you. If there are more we will kill more; if there are few we will kill fewer. CNN: The United States is sending more troops; is that going to change the war? Mujahid: If the Pentagon is thinking of changing its policy, we, too, are thinking of changing our policy. If they want to send 20,000 to start a new campaign, this is a war and we will see the war and make our policy. We also have the good players; we have the good experts of the war. CNN: Some people say President Obama has made Afghanistan a very big part of his foreign policy. Some people have suggested it may be his Vietnam. What is your opinion? Mujahid: If they want to send the troops and change things we believe they can't do anything because the 40 countries don't make any good achievements inside Afghanistan. Yes Afghanistan will be the Vietnam for them. Concerning their policy it is the same Bush policy; there are no changes in this policy. I want to tell you clearly we will win, and they will die. CNN: Can the Taliban win by military means alone or does there have to be some kind of talks? Mujahid: We believe by both, by negotiation and also by war. We ask them to leave the country; we are ready to talk. So if they are not ready to leave and they want to talk by the mouth of the gun, we will talk by the mouth of the gun. CNN: What are your terms for talking. What are the Taliban terms for talking? Mujahid: Our conditions are clear. We want to negotiate and they will not interfere in our affairs. Secondly, they will leave the country. Third, leave the Afghan people to do what they want to do, like the Islamic government they want to establish. CNN: The talks last year in Saudi Arabia -- were they helpful? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly there is no peace talks or negotiations in Saudi Arabia. CNN: Are there any talks at all with the Afghan government? Mujahid: The Taliban under the field commander Mullah Mohammed Mujahadid do not have any representatives in peace talks. I want to tell you two things clearly. First I want to tell you some people take the former Taliban to Saudi Arabia to negotiate. They are not our representatives. Some people they sit in Kabul and talk. They are not our representative. [When] one wants to talk with us and we want to talk, it will be clear. Our representatives' names will be clear. We will announce the people. CNN: So how long is this war going to last? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly it is war. Some people will be very weak but we will win. We will win. This is war. I cannot tell you who is going to win but I can tell you one thing. [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel when she is coming to Kunduz -- before she is coming we had intelligence reports tell us she is coming, we had the information she is coming. We did the rocket attack and she escaped, so will show them and they escaped. I will tell you we will win; we have the support of Muslim nations and this is what we believe. CNN: How do you get this intelligence? Do you have people inside American bases? Mujahid: The people who work with [Afghan President Hamid]Karzai they help us. Inside the American bases there are more people who help us, and we have intelligence from A to Z inside the foreign installations and the Afghan government. For example, on the day of the Afghan celebration [when a parade attended by President Karzai was attacked in April 2008] in the same team that work with Karzai they gave the information that he is coming. Then we attacked. CNN: So you have people inside American bases and you have people inside the ministers and you have people right next to President Karzai? Mujahid: Yes, certainly . CNN: So how come President Karzai is still alive? Mujahid: I ask you how strong the intelligence the United States has about Mullah Omar but they still don't kill him. We detect and if he is not killed this is something that belongs to God. He will be finished quickly. CNN: What is the relationship between Taliban and al Qaeda? Mujahid: Taliban is one thing and al Qaeda is another. They are global we are just in the region. CNN: Can you explain the differences between Taliban and al Qaeda. Mujahid: We are not under the command of al Qaeda. Some people are coming to fight and we say welcome. CNN: They come from al Qaeda.? Mujahid: Even any place including al Qaeda, but we don't fight under their instruction. CNN: But they help you, al Qaeda helps you? Mujahid: We are from this country; we are the boss. We do not have any link with them -- they do not have any link with us under the command of al Qaeda. If mujahadeen freely want to do jihad they can come.

{"id": 15372, "article": "Al-Zarqa, Jordan (CNN) -- Several civilians and scores of police officers were injured Friday when pro-monarchy supporters clashed with hard-line Islamic activists in this city a half hour northeast of the capital. The confrontation between government loyalists with dozens of Salafi jihadists -- followers of a strict interpretation of Islam who advocate jihad -- brought a violent end to what had been a largely peaceful demonstration during which protesters demanded the release of 200 jihadists being held in Jordanian prisons. The incident occurred as vehicles carrying Salafi activists came under a barrage of stones as they were leaving the city, the birthplace of former al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. As the clashes between stone-hurling loyalists and knife-wielding Salafis escalated, police fired tear gas to disperse them and traded a volley of stones with Salafi supporters, witnesses said. After the incident, Jordanian public security department chief Hussein Majali told reporters that 83 police officers sustained injuries -- including knife wounds -- in what he described as a \"premeditated attack\" by the Salafis. Of the total, 32 officers suffered smoke inhalation due to misfired tear gas, he added. Shiekh Saad Hneiti, a senior leader of the Jordanian Salafist movement, denied that there had been any premeditated attack, insisting that protesters picked up arms only in self-defense after coming under attack by pro-monarchy supporters. \"We were observing our right to peacefully express our opinions when we were attacked by plain-clothed security agents,\" Hneiti told CNN. He added that two members and a senior leader of the movement were hospitalized with mild to severe injuries following the incident. Hneiti vowed that Jordan's jihadists will continue to demonstrate in the streets until their demands are met. \"Our demands are pure and just and clear: we want our brothers freed from prison and to be governed by the Holy Quran, which most Jordanians support,\" Hneiti said. \"You can attack us, you can imprison us, but you can't stop the will of the Muslim nation.\" During Friday's two-hour demonstration, held at al-Zarqa's Omar bin Khatab Mosque, some 1,000 participants chanted slogans including \"The people want Sharia law,\" \"Down with America,\" and \"No to democracy, no to racism, no to globalism, only Islam.\" Salafi jihadists are among several groups taking advantage of newfound freedom in Jordan, holding demonstrations across the country over the past month, calling for the release of imprisoned jihadists, and for the implementation of Sharia law. Unlike pro-democracy activists who have held weekly demonstrations across the Hashemite Kingdom since early January, Salafis reject calls for political reform as they view the Jordanian regime as \"un-Islamic.\" The scene in Amman was more peaceful. There, more than 1,000 people marched Friday demanding democratic and economic reforms, protesting corruption and calling for social justice and constitutional changes. The protesters, from many political parties and opposition groups, took to the streets of the capital city demanding governmental and constitutional reforms and an end to what many call government corruption amid tight security from hundreds of police and security personnel. Laila Naffa, 66, a leader of the Communist Party -- one of the main political parties demanding reform -- said that, amid ongoing revolutions across the Arab world, Jordanians too want change. \"Today with the revolutions sweeping the Arab world, Jordanians are taking to the street asking for the same slogans, freedom, social justice, because after the signing of the Wadi Araba Treaty with Israel, things have been deteriorating,\" Naffa said. The 1994 treaty normalized relations between the two countries. \"Now we are asking to reform the system, freedom rights for legalizing political parties and for getting rid of the current political parties law, calling (for) and demanding free elections under the auspices of the judiciary control, reform of the constitution. ... This should be done through national dialogue and by the king to assure this will be implemented,\" she added. Local media reported similar protests Friday in other cities, including Karak in the south and Irbid in the north. Jordanians have held regular protests since January. Most of them, unlike demonstrators in Arab countries that have seen uprisings, have not been seeking regime change but changes to the regime. In February, King Abdullah II sacked his prime minister and cabinet and instituted a number of economic measures and promises of political reform in an effort to appease those demands. But the protesters' list of demands grew longer as many Jordanians felt emboldened by the popular uprisings in the region. Although the protests in Amman have been largely peaceful, more than 100 people were injured and one person died last month when pro-government loyalists attacked anti government protesters with sticks and stones. A CNN team at the protest reported that police forces used water cannon and batons to disperse a sit-in in a main Amman square. Mohamad Khateeb, a spokesman for the public security directorate, said Friday's demonstrations in Amman were peaceful. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Kareem Khadder and Journalist Taylor Luck contributed to this story.", "reference": "NEW: Several civilians and scores of police officers hurt in al-Zarqa .\nHundreds march in Amman and other cities across Jordan .\nProtesters call for government, constitutional reforms .\nNo violence reported during demonstrations in capital ."}

The grainy clip, which echoes that of British toddler James Bulger being walked to his death in 1993, shows the girl, nicknamed 'Nong Cartoon', strolling with a stranger through the lobby of Bearing skytrain station in Bangkok ten days ago. Her disappearance sparked a massive police hunt that ended yesterday with the discovery of her strangled and decomposing body in a deserted area near the city's Suklhumvit Soi 501 motorway in a case that has shaken the nation.

'Cartoon' vanished from her father's pick-up truck where she had been sleeping while he watched the end of a folk music concert in Thailand's capital on November 6. Her father, Sayan Petchdon, had taken her to the show, which starred the popular band 'Mai Thai Hui Jai Silp', with seven friends but, when she grew sleepy, he took her to nap in the vehicle outside the venue at around 10.20pm. After staying with her for ten minutes, he returned to watch the end of the concert which finished at 11. When he came back to the truck less than 40 minutes later she was gone. Sayan wept uncontrollably when he was shown the girl's white floral pants which police found near her body, according to reports. A child's skull, believed to be hers, was also found nearby.

Millions of pounds in benefits are to be offered to communities to persuade people to agree to new nuclear power stations being built near their homes. Towns and villages near eight sites in England and Wales will be offered up to £1,000 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated for 40 years. It means people living near Hinkley Point in Somerset are in line for £128million if a new nuclear generator goes ahead. Cash: Communities near new nuclear power stations will receive millions in bribes, including Hinkley Point in Somerset (pictured) which is in line for £128million . Energy minister Michael Fallon insisted it is ‘absolutely essential’ to recognise the contribution towns and villages make to national energy security by having a reactor built nearby. Under the package, councils would benefit for up to the first 10 years of operation of a nuclear power plant from a share of the increased business rates revenues that will be generated. Then during the second phase of the programme there would be annual taxpayer-funded payments between 2030 and 2060 from the Department of Energy and Climate Change to communities hosting nuclear power plants. Mr Fallon said: ‘New nuclear will have a central role to play in our energy strategy, providing heat and light to homes across the country. Energy minister Michael Fallon said the funding was 'absolutely essential' ‘It is absolutely essential that we recognise the contributions of those communities that host major new energy projects. ‘This package is in the interests of local people, who will manage it to ensure long-term meaningful benefit to the community. ‘It's proportionate to the scale and lifespan of new nuclear power stations and it builds on the major economic benefits they will bring in terms of jobs, investment and use of local services.’ Community benefits packages have been announced for other controversial energy infrastructure, including onshore wind farms and ‘fracking’ for shale gas, but in those cases the developer will pay for them. David Hall, a county councillor in Somerset, welcome the funds for the area near Hinkley Point. He added: ‘The money is a tremendous asset to our county and will help create jobs and apprenticeships, provide essential improvements like affordable housing and regenerate areas that could really do with financial help. Construction of the first of a planned new generation of nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point has stalled as EDF and officials have so far failed to agree a price for the electricity which will be generated from the Hinkley Point site. But Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: ‘Whilst wind farms and even shale gas developers have to pay community benefits, only nuclear stations will get a fat taxpayer subsidy to fund them. ‘Our entire energy policy is now absurdly distorted by the desperation to prop up EDF's faltering Hinkley C project, with the Government piling the costs on to the taxpayer to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they backed the wrong technology. We can't go on like this.’", "reference": "Cash on offer for eight sites in England and Wales to agree to new reactors .\nIt could be worth £128million for people near Hinkley Point in Somerset .\nEnergy minister Michael Fallon says money is 'absolutely essential'"}
{"id": 15376, "article": "(InStyle) -- Oscar night is Hollywood's main fashion event, and most notable on the red carpet this year was our favorite actresses stepping out in uber feminine -- not just fashion forward -- looks. Indeed, from the most delicate shades of blush to the boldest fuchsia, the red carpet turned pink! Exaggerated ruffles, soft draping, frothy fabrics, dramatic trains and Cinderella-esque silhouettes gave new meaning to the term Hollywood royalty. The few celebrities who bucked the romantic trend, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep, chose sophisticated styles with retro vibes. From a timeless beauty (Demi Moore) to a graceful Hollywood icon (Meryl Streep), here are the night's fashion winners. Demi Moore . Demi Moore often chooses classic, tailored cuts, but last night she glowed in a stunning blush-toned Atelier Versace silk organza gown with petal-like tiers of ruffles. She finished off this softer look with Van Cleef & Arpels tassel earrings and diamond cuffs, a gold leather Salvatore Ferragamo clutch and dress-matching Versace satin sandals. Diane Kruger . The ever-flawless Diane Kruger turned to her favorite designer Karl Lagerfeld for her cream and black chiffon gown from Chanel Haute Couture. Both edgy and feminine, the design featured a pleated and ruffled skirt that led into a bow-bedecked mermaid train. See more dresses from the 2010 Academy Awards . Jennifer Lopez . We love the way Jennifer Lopez commands the red carpet in dramatic dresses, and her choice this year was no exception. Yet rather than going sexy (down-to-there Versace, anyone?), the diva went spectacular in a full-on princess-shaped icy pink Armani Prive confection with a Swarovski crystal-studded waterfall train. Charlize Theron . While still incredibly feminine, Charlize Theron's Dior Haute Couture gown was also most daring with its rosette-bedecked bustline. The custom-designed dress combined a curve-hugging lilac column with a wow-worthy train of amethyst satin. Anna Kendrick . Talk about pretty -- nominee Anna Kendrick selected a pale pink couture gown from Elie Saab that featured beautiful details like hand-draped rosettes and lace edging. The \"Up in the Air\" star added matching platform sandals and delicate Kwiat diamonds. Oscars: Top 7 Fashion Trends . Zoe Saldana . \"Avatar\" beauty Zoe Saldana walked the red carpet in one of the night's most memorable gowns: a purple ombre design from Givenchy Haute Couture that paired a flower-like tulle skirt with a shimmering bodice. We loved the artistic take on traditional feminine flourishes. Penelope Cruz . On the sultry end of the romantic trend was Best Supporting Actress nominee Penelope Cruz in a shape-draping duchesse satin Donna Karan design. After an awards season of black and black, it was a pleasure to see the \"Nine\" star in a deep shade of bordeaux. Oscars: Best Hair and Makeup . Sarah Jessica Parker . We've come to expect the unexpected from Sarah Jessica Parker (and are never disappointed). This year, Parker skipped the frills in favor of a '60s-inspired Chanel Haute Couture column gown topped with elaborate silver embroidery. The shape, the color and the details were simply perfect, as was her stunning mix of jewelry: a stack of Fred Leighton bracelets paired with a spiked crescent ring. Sandra Bullock . It was Sandra Bullock's night both inside the Kodak Theatre and on the red carpet. Eschewing pink, the Best Actress winner looked luminous in an ethereal silver beaded Marchesa column with a peek-a-boo lace bodice. She accented the stunning design with understated diamond jewelry and a textured minaudiere. Best Jewelry at the Oscars . Meryl Streep . Nominee Meryl Streep embodied the iconic era of elegance in a strong-shouldered '40s-inspired custom design from Chris March. The \"Julie & Julia\" lead chose similarly fuss-free accessories including a Swarovski silver crystal mesh clutch and diamond and black onyx Fred Leighton jewels.

A cruel couple who were captured on tape forcing two little children aged under eight to have an armed fight have been jailed. Ian Barclay, 20, and Gemma Mattinson, 26, made the boy and girl brawl then laughed and cheered as the youngsters cried in pain and through fear. The shocking incident was captured on a mobile phone at a house in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and showed the girl, wearing a pink dress, being ordered to kick, punch and hit the boy with a broom, which is much bigger than her. Jailed: Ian Barclay and Jemma Mattinson made the boy and girl, aged under eight, brawl as they laughed and cheered. Several people left the court as the video of the fight was played to the jury . Both children could be heard sobbing as the boy tried to hide behind a sofa but was dragged across the floor and banged into a radiator by Barclay. Several distressed people left the public gallery at Newcastle Crown Court in tears yesterday as the three-minute film was played. Prosecutor Glenda Turnbull told the court: 'The defendants encouraged the children to fight each other. 'They were both instructing the girl how to attack the boy, telling her what to do, bringing the children together, providing her with plastic sticks and a broom to use against him. 'The video footage is distressing, the children are crying.' Miss Turnbull said it is unclear what injuries the children suffered. Barclay can be heard shouting 'punch him, kick him, nut him' on the tape and the girl is given sticks and a broom to use as a weapons. When the children tried to separate they were pushed back together and goaded into fighting more, despite them screaming in terror. The pair were arrested when the person who taped the cruelty showed the footage to a relative of one of the children. Mattinson, from Gateshead, told police she didn’t realise what went on was 'quite as bad' until she saw the footage. Barclay, from Gateshead, said it was a 'joke that had gone too far'. Both of them admitted child cruelty charges and have previous convictions for violence, though not against children. Judge Roger Thorn jailed them both for eight months each. Jailed: Ian Barclay, 20, and Gemma Mattinson, 26, were given just eight months behind bars each by the judge at Newcastle Crown Court . He said: 'You put them up to fight each other as though they were toys in some Roman Amphitheatre for the sport of those watching. 'What happens beggars belief. There would be public outrage if this was not met with an immediate custodial sentence.' Judge Thorn said the footage caused 'revulsion' to decent minded people who had viewed it and said even he could not put into words what he had seen. The judge said: 'Words would fail to describe it. The distress of both children was apparent from watching that DVD.' The court heard Barclay’s family have disowned him because of what he did. Mattinson gave birth to a child on Saturday which has since been taken off her. Speaking after the hearing, the father of one of the children said he was outraged by the sentences. He said: 'The judge said he had to follow guidelines in relation to length of the sentences and I accept that but i think its time these guidelines were reviewed. 'To do what they did is just beyond belief. I couldn’t watch the video, I had to run out of court when it was played. 'My child went through all this and those two seemed to think it was funny. 'There should be some sort of register they have to sign so everybody knows what they have done and they dont get the chance to be near any children in future.'", "reference": "Girl in pink dress is ordered to beat a boy with a broom which was bigger than her as the defendants laughed and cheered .\nIan Barclay, 20, and Gemma Mattinson, 26, are jailed for just eight months ."}

Inconsolable: Makenzie Jauer, the girlfriend of The Real World Star Ryan Knight, paid tribute on Instagram after he was found dead at 29 following a night of partying, according to reports . Happy memories: Seen here in a snap posted four months ago with the message: 'This was such a fun day. I would do anything to be back there right now' A close friend reportedly told the site that he was found dead by his friends on Thursday morning. TMZ also report that several close friends of Knight claim he had taken some pills but did not specify what kind, while another friend claims he had 'choked on his own vomit'. The website claims that no cause of death was found following an autopsy on Friday morning, and therefore will not be determined until the toxicology results come in. TMZ alleges that Knight's father said the late star had stomach pains in the two days before his death, but that police found no clear signs of injury.

His and hers facials: Six months, Makenzie shared this fun picture, writing: '23 days without you is way too long. Who am U supposed to do facials mask with?'

She wrote: 'I love you Ryan Knight. I am heartbroken, confused, hurt and most of all mad. The pain I am feeling now will never go away. 'You mean more to me than you will ever know & I never thought that I would spend a day without you. Every second with you was full of love and laughter. You were the brightest light in every room.' She went on: 'You taught me not to care about what other people think and you made me understand that being myself was okay. Thank you for being inappropriate at the worst of times and making me laugh until I cried. Young love: Makenzie uploaded this snap five months ago, noting that she had just picked him up from the airport . Twitter tributes: Knight's MTV co-stars took to social media to pay their respects . 'Thank you for loving me unconditionally even though I snored and drooled on you in my sleep. You had the sweetest soul and I will never forget that. I always called you \"my sweet angel\" and now you truly are. Love you forever, MEK.' Other co-stars from The Real World also took to social media to pay their respects, including his ex-girlfriend Jemmye Carroll who thanked her followers for their kind words. She added: 'Words will never be enough to justify the connection we shared and the pain I will forever feel. RIP.' Worryingly, Knight's last tweet on Wednesday was simply a message that read: 'You used to mean a lot.' Worrying: Knight's last tweet on Wednesday, just hours before he was found dead . Tragedy: Knight - pictured here in September 2013 in New York - had reportedly taken some pills just hours before his death and chocked on his own vomit, according to friends .

Following The Challenge, Diem did make a name for herself as an entertainment reporter after and their paths crossed on the reality television circuit. He was known as a bit of a villain on the reality show, and Knight himself jokingly put his Twitter bio as: 'Sooooo I'm the a**hole'.

Loitering by the side of the dusty motorway in a skimpy lilac dress which hung loose from her birdlike body, the girl looked lost and painfully alone in the dark Brazilian night. It was 1.30am and there was no obvious explanation why she should be on a nightmarish stretch of road rather than asleep in her own bed. But the deeply disturbing truth was this. At the age of 11, Leliah, with her childlike and fragile limbs, was selling herself for sex to any truck driver prepared to pay. Scroll down for video . Sold for sex: Leilah, 11, standing by the side of the dusty motorway as she waits for truck drivers to pick her up . Trapped in prostitution: Thousands of underage girls who are sold for sex every ten miles along Brazil's 2,7000 BR-116 motorway . ‘When he’s finished he throws me out . of the cab’, she said, showing her battered and bruised elbows. ‘Sometimes they let me climb down, or sometimes they just kick me out . onto the concrete. ‘But I never sell myself short. I charge 25 reals (£10) a time’. For . British journalist Matt Roper, this chance meeting with Leliah was to . change his life. He drove off along the BR-116 motorway, a merciless . 2,700-mile stretch of road spearing up the coast of Brazil from Rio de . Janerio to Fortaleza, in a state of profound shock. Later he decided to investigate and write about the forgotten children who eke out a living on the Highway to Hell. And despite being a hardened news reporter, nothing had prepared him for the scale of depravity he was to uncover. Abandoned: Lilian, a 12-year-old whose mother abandoned her. Her neighbour forced her to prostitute herself, but she was later stabbed in the neck at a bar and fell pregnant . Left: Mara, 16, left,  performed an abortion on herself after being raped by her landlord and right, Josilene, 15, who would end up miles away from home on the motorway after selling her body . Leliah . was just one of thousands of girls – some as young as nine - sold for . sex every ten miles along the BR-116. Many are prostituted by their own . families. The cheapest fee for a transaction is £8. 'I . was expecting to find something alarming, something that would make a . shocking investigative story, but never this,' Roper said. 'I’d stumbled . upon what appeared to be an epidemic of child prostitution, involving . thousands of young, innocent girls. 'Every . story I heard was more distressing than the last and the girls were all . so vulnerable, completely alone and unprotected. It broke my heart. 'I . later discovered a hushed-up Brazilian government report into the . motorway, which had identified 262 places along the motorway where . children were known to be sold for sex – that’s one, on average, every . ten miles. Dedicated: Matt Roper, centre, talks to local girls in Brazil. He moved to the South American country with his wife and young son in 2011 . With the help of children’s councillor Rita Marques, who is based in the town of Medina, Roper began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted before they had even reached adulthood . “I couldn’t understand how this tragedy had been kept hidden, unreported, for so long.” With . the help of children’s councillor Rita Marques, who is based in the . town of Medina, Roper began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted . before they had even reached adulthood. One of the most horrific cases involved a 16-year-old called Mara, who lived with her mother and two brothers in Serrinha. At . the age of 11, their landlord Jonas began to sell her for sex because . he gave the young girl food when her mother went to work. He . also raped her and she fell eventually pregnant. Jonas forced her to . carry out a horrific abortion using a coat hanger, leaving her bleeding . and distraught. She turned to drugs and is now being pimped out by . local gangsters. And then . there was Mariana. At 13, she was forced to sell her body on the . motorway by her own mother Maria. Sometimes her parent would even walk . her to the road, negotiate her price and then greedily snatch away the . money for cigarettes. If Mariana failed to attract a customer, she . would face a beating when she returned home. Safe haven: Determined to help the girls Roper set up a charity in the UK called Meninadança. With the funds raised the charity decided to create a safe space for the girls and now rent a building known by locals as the Pink House . Inspiring: The wall of the Pink House's dance class which reads: 'Don't be the girl who fell. Be the girl who got on her feet again' Hope: Run by Ms Marques, nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors since it opened at the beginning of the year, with around 60 coming to the project every day . Brazil’s . relaxed attitude to buying sex has long attracted international . criticism - UNICEF estimates there are 250,000 children into . prostitution across the country. And . as Brazil prepares to host the next World Cup and Olympics 2016, the . South American nation is under the pressure to break the growing problem . of child prostitution racket. Brazilian . law dictates that an adult subjecting a child to prostitution or sexual . exploitation is punishable by imprisonment for four to ten years and a . fine, but countless times Roper came across young girls who told him . their abuser had not been punished. He . even went on a raid with local police to track down girls being abused . in motels, although was disheartened by what he saw – police gave motel . owners enough time to warn their customers as well as giving up if . punters did not answer the door after a 10-minute wait. Roper had moved to Brazil with his wife Dani, 26, and their son Milo, three, in November 2011. He had always intended to write about the girls, but now he decided that he would also set up a charity to help them. Sisters Rebeca, 15, and Milene, 12, from the Chilli Peppers in Salgueiro. Rebeca is a mother of two - she has a two-year-old and six-month-old baby . Message: Girls who spend time at The Pink House paint a mural on the wall in their local community . Working . with his friend Canadian country singer Dean Brody who had been with . him on the night he met Leliah, Roper set up a charity called to Meninadança provide refuge for the children who had been forced into . prostitution. They established The Pink House in Medina, where visitors . can talk about their experiences, take dance and beauty classes and . find support. Run by Ms . Marques, nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors . since it opened at the beginning of the year, with around 60 coming to . the project every day. Meanwhile, . Roper had had a second encounter with the young girl who was . prostituting herself so her mother could afford cigarettes. Now she was 15, seven months pregnant and dancing for a scruffy, unshaven man in a brothel. ‘My . mum never cared about me. She was just interested in using me to buy . her cahaca. So I ran away. At least now I can keep the money for . myself’, she told him. Road of misery: Brazil's BR-116 motorway also known as the 'highway to hell' by the girls who sexually abused every day . With . the help of Ms Marques, Roper persuaded Mariana that she did not have to . stay in this sordid place. After persuading the town’s judge to . forcibly take her away from the mother who was exploiting her, the . journalist and his wife took her in and, despite being unable to keep . her baby, she has now settled into their home. Her 16th birthday was celebrated with a huge party. ‘I . wept as I saw her, beaming radiant, surrounded by new friends and . family. I could hardly believe she was the same girl we had found less . than a year ago, dancing lifelessly inside that dark oppressive roadside . brothel,’ Roper said. Later, . Roper and his wife took another girl into their home who workers at the . Pink House had discovered was in danger. Nathane, 13, was sleeping in . friends’ houses after her mother died, and was on the brink of falling . into the dark work of child prostitution that had snared so many. Despite successes with Mariana and the Pink House, there was one girl that Roper could not forget. Haunted by Leilah, the ghostly girl in the lilac dress, the journalist set out to find her. It . was too late. Still a prostitute on the Highway To Hell, she was now . heavily addicted to crack cocaine and desperate for cash to buy drugs. When Roper refused, she became furious and snarled: ‘Don’t bother coming back.’", "reference": "Underage girls are sold for sex every ten miles along the BR-116 .\nYoung girls prostitute themselves every night for just £8 .\nThe law turns a blind eye to the crimes and perpetrators are unpunished .\nMatt Roper, a British journalist, investigated the extent of the abuse .\nHis charity Meninadança has set up a safe haven for 60 young girls .\nUNICEF estimates there are 250,000 children in prostitution across Brazil ."}

Naval sources in Crimea said the creatures had begun their first military exercises under commander-in-chief Vladimir Putin, a claim quickly denied by his Defence Ministry. In a day of Cold War-style intrigue and subterfuge, Russian officials then cast doubt on the existence of a dolphin naval squad - three months after heralding their 'defection' from Ukraine following Moscow's annexation of Crimea. A Russian military dolphin is photographed carrying an underwater bomb. The specially trained animals came under Moscow's control when Russian siezed Crimea from Ukraine in March . Naval sources in Crimea said the creatures had begun their first military exercises under commander-in-chief Vladimir Putin, a claim quickly denied by his Defence Ministry . Some news sources quickly insisted the Russian Black Sea fleet was not involved in any military use of dolphins, leading to uncertainty over their whereabouts and role . Confusion about the dolphins surfaced after a report by a state owned news agency Sputnik claimed Russia's Black Sea Fleet Special Forces had initiated its first exercises with the combat dolphins since they were taken from Ukraine. A military source said: 'Training exercises were held in the Sevastopol Oceanarium in the search of military equipment at a depth of over 60 metres. An object that looked like a mine was spotted by a dolphin and tagged with a buoy. 'We had to practically start from scratch to teach the [mammals] to search for objects under the water because the Ukrainian Navy hardly worked with them.' But other news sources quickly insisted the Russian Black Sea fleet was not involved in any military use of dolphins, leading to uncertainty over their whereabouts and role. In March, Russian media reported that the dolphins had 'defected' to Moscow - along with many Ukrainian forces in Crimea - but now Russia has cast doubt on whether the squad even exists . Swimming: It's thought that Moscow has taken charge of 13 elite units of dolphins, and a number of military sea lions . Major General Igor Konashenkov, the Defence Ministry's official spokesman, said: 'There have been, and there are, no training exercises with dolphins. 'The bases of the Black Sea Fleet are safely protected by special technical means of anti-sabotage forces, that's why there is no need in using exotic ways of safeguarding adjacent waters.' The office of the commander of the Russian Navy said dolphins had been used during the Soviet era, but this work had stopped and the animals had been sold off. A source said: 'All services that were involved in the military training of dolphins in the Black Sea fleet under the Soviets were abolished after the collapse of the Soviet Union, almost quarter a century ago. 'No decisions on their restoration was made after Crimea's unification to Russia. 'Everyone who has been to a dolphinarium at least once knows that dolphins and seals can be trained to do anything. The question is if the military need that.' One observer said: 'Perhaps the dolphins are KGB not military agents. Maybe they are now on a special mission which is why they deny their existence.' Highly trained: The combat dolphins are prepared for military duties at the Crimean State Oceanarium, which was inherited by Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed 23 years ago . Display: The military dolphins are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Pictured is a fully kitted-out model of a military dolphin . The Russian military dolphin training programme dates back to Cold War era of the 1970s when the Soviet Union utilised the animals in Sevastopol to search for mines or spy on foreign ships. After the fall of the USSR, they were passed to the Ukrainian Navy but when Russia annexed Crimea in March, the animals were reported to have returned to the control of Moscow. In September Acting Sevastopol governor Sergei Menyailo said: 'The jurisdiction over this facility has been fully transferred to the Russian Defence Ministry.' The unit included 13 elite dolphins as well as a number of sea lions, it was claimed. The creatures are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Others were schooled for anti-sabotage and rescue missions. NATO is now running constant patrols in the Black Sea due to the Ukrainian crisis, leading to speculation Russia could deploy them against Western ships. Shortly after the annexe of Crimea, Moscow acknowledged that the bottlenose dolphins had 'defected' to Russia along with many Ukrainian forces. The Sevastopol facility is said to be one of only two such combat dolphin training centres in the world. The other is run by the US Navy in San Diego, which also pioneered their use for military purposes.

It would be wise to keep away from this leopard, because after its latest meal it'll be feeling a bit prickly. The big cat must have been extremely hungry to even think of tackling a porcupine bristling with needle-sharp quills. But the battle commenced and the leopard suffered for its supper. It was speared by the quills in its muzzle, chest, and paws. Prickly: This leopard, pictured at the Kruger National Park in South Africa, tried to make a porcupine his dinner . The battle commenced and the leopard suffered for its supper by being speared by the quills in its muzzle, chest, and paws . In obvious discomfort from the . impalement, according to witnesses, the leopard took time out to try and . swat the quills from its body with its paws. Yet the sheer persistence of the leopard and its need for food drove it to ignore the pain and continue its quest. Eventually, it found a way to pick its way through the quills and subdued the porcupine. The unfortunate prickly beast was dragged off into scrubland at the side of a road. These extraordinary pictures were taken by Sam Jones, 42, an intensive care nurse at a hospital in Carlisle, Cumbia, when she went on a 12-day safari to the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Hungry: Looking for something to eat, the leopard surveys the body of its prey . Persistence: Hungry like the wolf, this leopard ignored the pain and continued its quest to get a bite to eat . Had enough? These extraordinary pictures were taken by Sam Jones, 42, an intensive care nurse at a hospital in Carlisle, Cumbria . Her jeep stopped to allow the party to view the leopard versus food battle on a road between Satara and Skukuza. She said: 'I think the leopard had been chasing the porcupine, which can move quite fast, and it ran out onto the road where the leopard caught it. 'At one point the leopard was pawing at its own face to try and remove the quills. It looked uncomfortable . 'It is just nature in action and that is the way it is. I was very lucky to see something like this out in the open. It is a very unusual sight.' A porcupine's quills are normally off-white and black and are made out of keratin. Up to 30,000 quills cover the average porcupine which can grow up to 30cm long. Because of its natural defence mechanism, porcupines do not have to fear being eaten by very many animals. But unlike this leopard, three animals have figured out how to eat porcupines. Bobcats, cougars and fishers, which are native to north America, have learned that a porcupine has no quills . on its stomach. So one of these predators will sometimes kill and eat a . porcupine by flipping it onto its back and biting into its vulnerable . belly. But few animals know this porcupine-eating trick.Other animals that try to eat them include  lions, hyenas and birds of prey, but they are rarely successful. And, what do porcupines eat? A porcupine eats tender bark and twigs, along with other types of vegetation.", "reference": "Extraordinary pictures were taken by Sam Jones, 42, from Carlise .\nShe was on a 12-day safari to Kruger National Park in South Africa ."}

Oprah Winfrey may be one of the richest Americans, but after a string of recent real estate investment losses she might consider keeping her billions in the media business. The lady billionaire’s most recent hit came as her company sold retail space that once contained her Oprah Store at a loss of more than $1 million. The sale comes after the company’s closing of the store itself, which was shuttered just after Oprah signed off the daytime airwaves for good in 2011. Fizzle: Oprah Winfrey knows how to make money in media, but the billionaire has taken more than one fat loss in the real estate game . The space, which sat just across from the talk queen’s Harpo Studios in Chicago, cost the company $1.98 million, but it ultimately sold for only $875,000, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Oprah Store sold Oprah logo-emblazoned designer wear from ‘Oprah’s Closet’ and gave proceeds to charity. The law firm that orchestrated the sale said the space is set to become a meditation center. This is not the first time an Oprah-backed real estate investment brought a big loss. Last summer, Ms. Winfrey sold an eight-bedroom co-op unit in Chicago’s Streeterville neighbourhood for $2.75 million, a unit for which she paid a whopping $5.6 million in 2006. Loss: around $3 million. Ouch: The Oprah Store in Chicago closed after Winfrey's talk show ended in 2011. The space was recently sold at a $1 million loss to her company . Ooohm: The store sat just across from Oprah's Harpo Studios in Chicago. It will now become a meditation center . Oprah, by the way, never even moved into the place. These are two sharp blows to the media savvy businesswoman, ones that followed the mightiest of blows: when her much anticipated OWN Network hit airwaves to disappointing numbers. But since the network’s dark first days, things have begun to look up and Oprah may yet redeem her juggernaut status among TV types. Repeat: The Oprah Store, pictured, was just one of her real estate flops. She sold a Chicago condo in July at a $3 million loss . The Oprah Winfrey Network—its full name—has been gaining steam since landing an exclusive first interview with shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong. And Forbes reports that Discovery Channel, which partnered with Oprah on the OWN venture, has confidently reported that the cable network could be in the black by the end of 2013. Oprah is currently the only African American billionaire, with a reported worth of $2.8 billion. Hope: Things may be on the up for Winfrey, though. The OWN network, which tanked initially, is showing marked improvement and her partners at Discovery Channel say it could be in the black by the end of 2013 .", "reference": "The Queen of Daytime took an even bigger loss last summer when she sold a Chicago co-op she never even moved into for $3M less than she paid in 2006 .\nHer billions also took a hit after her OWN Network debuted with meager ratings, but things look like they may be looking up for the media maven ."}

Frank Sinatra's assistant has revealed juicy details of the legendary singer's bad behavior and his callous treatment of the stunning women who loved him. Tony Consiglio's interviews are the basis from a new book Sinatra and Me: The Very Good Years,  released following his death in 2008. It tells of his 50 years working for his former high school friend from Hoboken, New Jersey. Consiglio told of one episode where Sinatra ordered him to throw a plate of spare ribs covered in sauce in the face of a glamorous starlet he was dating. The very good years: Frank Sinatra and his loyal assistant Tony Consiglio who acted out every whim of the legendary singer . The memorable incident happened when the two friends were drinking at the Claridge Hotel in Atlantic City. The actress who was romantically involved with Sinatra had earlier offended him with her political views. When she went to slip into sexy negligee, the singer ordered Consiglio to follow her up to the  hotel room with a special request. He said: 'I went to her room and . knocked on the door. She opened the door wearing a beautiful light . chiffon dressing gown over a transparent white negligee...I told her . that I was sorry to bother her, and that Frank had insisted that I . deliver the spareribs. 'When she reached out for the plate I . hit her in the face with the ribs, sauce and all. I apologized again and . went back to the suite,' according to the New York Post. Fiery relationship: Frank Sinatra had a tumultuous marriage to actress Ava Gardner - with Tony Consiglio often cleaning up after their legendary fights . Glamor: Consiglio partied with Sinatra at the Claridge Hotel, Atlantic City at the height of the singer's fame . Consiglio told about his many . years by Sinatra's side to journalist Franz Douskey in a series of . interviews before his death in 2008. For years he had been known as the . 'Clam' for keeping his boss's secrets. Even after Sinatra's death in 1998, Consiglio kept the star's secrets - only opening up in the months before his own death ten years later. Juicy: The bad behavior of Frank Sinatra is revealed in a tell-all memoir published this month . The loyal employee revealed one . incident where Sinatra sent him to find his then wife Ava Gardner's . wedding ring after she threw it out of a 14-story hotel room window during an . explosive fight. As Sinatra and Gardner made up, . Consiglio checked the New York sidewalk with a flashlight for hours and . eventually found the ring under a fire hydrant. The book was published earlier this . month and contains dozens of never-before published photos of the two . friends spanning from the 1930s to 1970s. The . valet said that he enjoyed taking care of Sinatra's day-to-day needs - . allowing the crooner to focus on the music. He kept up to $20,000 in his . pockets to deal with Sinatra's ever-changing whims. In . another legendary incident, Sinatra decided that he didn't want . Consiglio to be gambling despite the fact he wasn't working at the time. He dutifully obeyed but Consiglio's loyalty did not go unrewarded this time. Consiglio . recalled that within the hour, a 'tall blonde' was sent to his hotel . room, to make sure he didn't return to the casino - causing him to remain in his room for three days.

{"id": 15387, "article": "(CNN) -- Frequent flyer programs are meant to breed passenger loyalty. The logic goes that if travelers can earn free tickets and preferential treatment by flying one airline or alliance, they will. A new study shows that this isn't always the case. A poll of 1,005 British citizens conducted by Collinson Latitude found that 40% of those signed up to airline loyalty schemes never redeem miles, which, one would imagine, slightly defeats the purpose. Given the many seeming limitations associated with them -- blackout dates, minimum spends, expiry dates -- it's not surprising. \"It's ironic that what is meant to be a key benefit for travelers becomes a key frustration quite quickly,\" says James Berry, product director for Collinson Latitude. Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorksCompany, which consults airlines on how to build and improve their loyalty schemes, says he doesn't find the study surprising. \"The UK is a bit of an enigma in the market, as their three largest airlines don't encourage people to sign up to their programs,\" he says. British Airways' scheme, titled the Executive Club, is almost exclusively geared towards business travelers, he says, while neither Ryan Air nor EasyJet have designated programs. Is that seat free? Still, if a good loyalty scheme is rated on the ease of acquiring a reward seat, the British carriers aren't the only ones letting customers down. IdeaWorksCompany recently conducted research as part of the Switchfly Reward Seat Availability Survey. Throughout March, they made 7,560 queries for free seats on 25 leading airlines, and tallied the percentages that were available. Air Berlin, GOL and Southwest tied for top spot, each able to accommodate queries 100% of the time. Delta and US Airways tied for last place, with only 36.5% of requests resulting in a potential booking. Read more: Airbus rolls out new A350 XWB . The discrepancy, Sorensen says, simply comes down to the fact that some airlines think making reward seats available is good business practice, while others just don't see it as a priority. Arguably, some airlines are more interested in selling reward miles to third parties, such as banks, who can distribute the miles as rewards to their own customers. The practice is a multi-billion dollar earner for many carriers. \"They love cashing the checks from the banks, they just hate to give up those seats,\" quips Sorensen. More bang for your buck . Another major grievance for those polled by Collinson Latitude was the lack of affordability of reward seats, with 60% complaining it takes too long to earn enough miles to get anything of value. Gary Leff, the cofounder of frequent flyer community milepoint.com, and a consultant on the Freddie Awards, which recognizes airlines with the best loyalty schemes, notes that some carriers have hidden value that one might not realize from simply skimming their policy page online. Infographic: What we spend on business travel . \"Air France-KLM are particularly good,\" he says (the airline recently won four Freddie's for their Flying Blue program). \"They have frequent promotions that allow members to redeem international awards at just half the usual miles.\" The best part is that Air France-KLM are partnered with Delta, meaning if a member of Delta's SkyMiles program can't find the reward seat they want at the price they want, they could always try using those miles to book with Air France. Does it make you loyal? As only 60% of those polled seem to make use of their frequent flyer program, it's understandable to question whether these schemes succeed in building allegiance to a brand. Sorensen says sadly, it's a difficult prospect to measure. \"If we had an airline that would turn their program off, we would have empirical evidence one way or another, but no one has done that, because these programs are a weapon no one wants to be without.\"", "reference": "Recent survey found 40% of passengers never redeem loyalty miles .\nMany airlines don't see frequent flyer programs as a business priority .\nAir France-KLM seen as one of the best, partnering with Delta ."}

Four children and 18 adults were found either dead in the water or crammed into the cabin of a yacht, which overturned along with a dinghy off the coast of Samos. More than 30 survivors were also pulled from the Aegean sea by the Greek coastguard. Though the nationalities of the dead are unclear, the survivors included Somalis, Syrians and Eritreans. Scroll down for video . Capsized: The yacht, pictured in the Aegean sea, overturned last night, killing eighteen people . Disaster: The Greek coastguard dragged the yacht back to shore and righted it, after bodies of children were found in the cabin . Smugglers: Samos, a Greek island off the Turkish coast, is a hotspot for migrants and traffickers trying to enter the EU .

Escape: The passengers, thought to have been trying to enter the EU, including Somalis, Eritreans and Syrians . In recent years Samos has become a hotspot for smugglers and people traffickers because it is close to the Turkish coast. Rescue teams led a search for up to seven more people missing, in what was one of the deadliest migrant boat accidents in Greek waters in recent years and the third fatal one this year. The vessels overturned before dawn off the island of Samos, a favorite destination for migrant-smuggling gangs because it's close to the Turkish coast. The Greek coast guard said it was not immediately clear what caused the overloaded craft to capsize. Greece's merchant marine minister, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, said he was 'devastated' by the incident, adding that the government would press other European Union members to draw up a joint plan to fight migrant smugglers more effectively. 'Modern-day slave traders are making a fortune by place placing thousands of people's lives at risk, putting them on small and unsuitable boats at night in the Aegean,' he said. Fatal accidents are frequent as migrants risk the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey. Removed: The yacht was taken away by crane at the port of Malagrari on Samos . Loss: A Greek minister said that he was 'devastated' to hear of the loss of life in the accident . 'It is vital to understand what it is that routinely brings thousands of migrants to trust smugglers, face exorbitant costs, and risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels,' said migration expert Maurizio Albahari, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame. 'It's quite simple. It is legally impossible for them to travel safely on planes and ferries. But they risk... many dangers to escape despair, and are prepared to die in order to set off with new hope,' he said, adding that policymakers could consider off-shore asylum applications and a transnational coast guard effort to help prevent such deaths. Officials said 36 people - 32 men, three women and a child - were rescued, and the child was airlifted to a hospital on the mainland in critical condition. Survivors included 23 Somalis, nine Syrians and three Eritreans, the coast guard said. The child's nationality and the nationalities of those who died are unclear. Dangerous: A migration experts explained how many in war-torn Africa are 'prepared to die' in the hope of reaching Europe .

{"id": 15389, "article": "A massive security flaw that could let hackers listen in on private calls and read text messages has been revealed. The flaw, is in a global telecom network called Signal System 7 that helps phone carriers across the world, including AT&T and Verizon, route calls and texts. The flaws, to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month, are the latest in a string of major flaws in the system. The flaws are in a system called SS7, the global network that allows the world's cellular carriers to route calls, texts and other services to each other . The flaws discovered by the German researchers are actually functions built into SS7 for other purposes – such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower. However, hackers worked out a way to  repurpose the features for surveillance because of the lax security on the network. 'Experts say it's increasingly clear that SS7, first designed in the 1980s, is riddled with serious vulnerabilities that undermine the privacy of the world's billions of cellular customers,' said The Washington Post, which first uncovered flaws in the system earlier this year. The flaws discovered by the German researchers are actually functions built into SS7 for other purposes – such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower. However, hackers worked out a way to  repurpose the features for surveillance because of the lax security on the network.

'It's like you secure the front door of the house, but the back door is wide open,' Tobias Engel, one of the German researchers, told the Post. There also is potential to defraud users and cellular carriers by using SS7 functions, the researchers say. The The American Civil Liberties Union has even warned people against using their handset in light of the breaches. 'Don't use the telephone service provided by the phone company for voice,' principle technologist Christopher Soghoian told Gizmodo. Hackers worked out a way to repurpose the features networks use to connect calls for surveillance because of the lax security on the network. The voice channel they offer is not secure. 'You can use FaceTime, which is built into any iPhone, or Signal, which you can download from the app store. 'These allow you to have secure communication on an insecure channel.' He also believes that security agencies could be using the flaws. 'Many of the big intelligence agencies probably have teams that do nothing but SS7 research and exploitation.

{"id": 15390, "article": "Alastair Cook will be 30 on Christmas Day and should be able to celebrate his landmark birthday as England's World Cup captain. After a 'hell of a year', though, he will be taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider - as they have promised - all aspects of England's 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka as part of their scheduled series review, before announcing a 16-man tri-series squad on Saturday. Cook conceded after the margin of his fifth successive one-day international series defeat was confirmed on Tuesday as 5-2, by an 87-run trouncing at Colombo's Premadasa Stadium, that he has no 'divine right' to be selected to lead the team to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. Alastair Cook has endured a horrible series as England captain this winter in Sri Lanka . He can be encouraged, however, by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton's strong hint that - despite his 'miserable' run of form - he is highly likely to retain the gig. For Cook, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - because however England fare down under, with or without him, it is hard to envisage him being back for much more with his sheet-anchor skills in a fast-developing format. Downton also described 2014 as a 'traumatic' 12 months as he reflected on his tenure - which began at the start of January, as England were completing their unexpected whitewash Ashes defeat. One crisis after another followed, the messy aftermath of the Ashes including the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and resignation of coach Andy Flower. As Cook and Flower's replacement, the returning Peter Moores, tried to forge a 'new era', the captain especially endured the most taxing of summers as calls for his resignation started to wane only once England turned round their Test fortunes en route to a 3-1 win over India. After Tillekaratne Dilshan's century had helped to inflict England's final defeat of 2014, Cook said: 'It's been a hell of a year. Cook has consistently failed with the bat at the top of the order in one-day internationals . 'We haven't won a lot of games, and there's been a big change in personnel. 'It's certainly been a year of transition - from 15 months ago, when we were winning the Ashes at home, to what's happened. 'It's been a year you wouldn't expect, but England have found some outstanding cricketers as well.' Among them, perhaps most prominent are Moeen Ali and Gary Ballance - the latter palpably unlucky to be omitted from England's ODI squad in Sri Lanka and, even now, a plausible outsider to make the final 15 for that World Cup. Others, such as pace-bowling pair Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan, have made late surges for central roles at the global tournament - while Joe Root alone excelled himself amid the inconsistency elsewhere from the tourists. Asked to identify where England struggled most, Cook said: 'One of the hardest things was taking wickets up front - so Sri Lanka, most of the time, had a good base to get going from. 'The one game we did take early wickets, we won. 'Also, batting at the right rate without losing wickets. 'We were scoring at a good rate, but we weren't good enough to do it and keep wickets in hand.' England are still searching for that successful ODI formula, with the bat especially, which others seem to have hit upon first. Suranga Lakmal celebrates as Sri Lanka enacted a humiliating series win against England . Many key figures within the game have called on England to call time on Cook's captaincy . Scoring at a winning tempo, without a damaging risk factor, is a balance they find difficult to strike. Cook, however, is not above learning from others and adapting to effect improvement. 'The way Sanga [Kumar Sangakkara] and Dilshan played in particular, they've obviously taken the right options - good enough to hit the boundaries, and stay in. 'We've been hitting the boundaries, and not staying in.' As for his own continued lack of productivity at the top of the order - 119 runs in six innings at an average of 19.83 and strike rate of 67.23 - he knows much, much better is required. He said: 'There's not many players who've been at the top of the game for long periods and haven't had tough moments. 'There's no one, I don't think... maybe Bradman is one. 'Everyone has really tough moments, as a batter particularly, because it's a hard game. 'You're playing against the best players in the world, week in week out, at the top of the order. 'It's very easy sitting watching... it's harder walking out and doing it.'", "reference": "England lost against Sri Lanka in the ODI series this winter .\nAlastair Cook has consistently failed with the bat at the top of the order .\nBut he looks set to keep hold of the captaincy before the World Cup ."}
{"id": 15391, "article": "(CNN) -- Dear Justice Scalia, . Like everyone on the Internet, I read with interest your recent interview with New York magazine's Jennifer Senior. Many sections were intriguing, including your firm belief in the existence of the devil and your passing fondness for \"Duck Dynasty.\" You're a fascinating person. But one passage troubled me deeply. Not because of what they say about you, but because of what they say about me and us and this great country that we call the United States. It would be easy for me to laugh off the interview -- to write a column with a few \"argle-bargle\" or \"fairyland castle\" references. All in a day's work at the digital snark factory, right? More \"blurbing things on the Internet,\" to borrow your words. I'm not going to do that. Because when you, the Supreme Court justice who has power over my rights as a gay citizen, said that you \"have friends that I know, or very much suspect, are homosexual,\" but that you don't have any friends who are openly gay, I was at first shocked and then puzzled and then saddened -- both for you and for all of us. \"Have any of them come out to you?\" Senior asked. Your response: \"No. No. Not that I know of.\" At first that seemed unbelievable. How is it possible to live in 2013 America -- to be one of the most important and powerful people in 2013 America -- and not have any friends who are openly gay? Then I thought about it a little more. I'm gay, but, growing up in Oklahoma, I don't think I was friends with an openly gay person until I left the state, after high school. I've traveled around the country, to places such as Mississippi, where there are still people who aren't sure whether gays exist, much less whether they should befriend them. And I looked into the numbers. You're far from alone. According to a 2013 Gallup poll, a quarter of Americans said they, like you, do not have \"any friends or relatives or coworkers who have told (them), personally, that they are gay or lesbian.\" Meanwhile, respondents listed having gay and lesbian friends as the fourth most common reason for supporting same-sex marriage. Many people -- especially the \"shrilly liberal\" media -- would blame you for not knowing anyone who's openly gay. It would be hard to expect to be accepted by someone who wrote, in 2003, that Americans who don't want gays to work as teachers, business partners or scoutmasters are \"protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive.\" \"I would write that again,\" you said in the New York magazine interview. That's unfair, and it's a sign you're from another time -- that you need to do more to widen your influences, reading material and social circles. But I also don't blame you, personally. I blame all of us, including the gay community. The U.S. gay rights movement, as I'm sure you know, was founded on the idea that openness creates social and political change. It's easy to see how this is still true in Russia and Uganda, the centers of violent struggle for dignity for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. A transgender Ugandan man, Pepe Julian Onziema, recently wrote for this site that \"visibility is magical for those of us who once roamed the land like ghosts.\" Until I read your interview, though, I'd forgotten how much this \"magical\" visibility is needed in modern America. In the age of Anderson Cooper and Ellen DeGeneres, LGBT people have become invisible anew, hiding in plain sight. Either we're afraid to speak up, as was the case with the LGBT people I met in Mississippi, who can be fired from their jobs and evicted from their rental properties for doing so. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, we're demagogues -- screaming so loud we're no longer heard. At least not by that quarter of America that still doesn't know us. We've stopped listening, too, and stopped reaching out to the people like you whom we too often see as enemies and bigots -- and not as people. \"We don't know the other side anymore,\" Dahlia Lithwick wrote for Slate. \"We don't even know anyone like the other side anymore. We can't even believe those people exist anymore. And maybe this is really what the devil's been up to.\" I agree. And that's why I'm extending my hand in friendship. Not as some gay-hater snare trap, but as a genuine offer to talk through these issues if you'd like. I'd be honored to be your friend. I promise not to judge you. You, like me, are shaped by your personal experience. I'm sure there are plenty of things we share. I can quote \"Seinfeld\" and I sometimes question the narcissism of Facebook, too. All I would ask is that you withhold your judgment of me as well -- and to seek, whether it's from me or one of your closeted gay friends, to understand where we're coming from and why so many of us are offended by your opinions. I know that will be hard for someone who wears a black robe for a living. But it's also the first step in mending two countries into one. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D.

{"id": 15393, "article": "A Michigan man will now stand trial for multiple charges, including first-degree murder, for a home invasion, shooting and robbery occurred three years ago, after police linked him to the crime using a social media post and incremental evidence. Robert Hauser, 47, a Iosco Township landscaper who was known in the area for carrying large sums of cash, was shot to death in the basement of his secluded country home on New Years Eve 2011. Investigators allege that Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, posted on Facebook about one month after the murder saying: 'What to do?? ... 30K I have to spend.' Although there is no conclusive evidence putting Duke at the crime scene, police believe they have now collected enough through testimony to try him. Duke has been booked with first-degree murder, home invasion and related felony firearm charges. To stand trial: Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, has been charged with a long-unsolved Michigan murder after police collected a dossier of incremental evidence - including a social media post - against him . Livingston County District Judge Carol Sue Reader said the case was built on inferences and circumstantial evidence, including the Facebook post, The Livingston Daily reported. Part of the evidence were two bullet sabots - devices used to fire bullets that are smaller than the weapon they are being shot from - that were found at Hauser's home. A ballistic expert testified they were two halves of one sabot that was 'fired from the same barrel' of a Mossberg shotgun — the same type of rifle witnesses said Duke used for hunting practice the November before the murder, The Livingston Daily reported. Detective Mark Klein of the Livingston County Sheriff's Department said they found similar sabots at Duke's home and at the home of his father, James Duke. James Duke told police his adopted son had regularly been using his 12-gauge Mossberg and was an excellent shot. Police used the sabots to allege Hauser was in the basement of his home at the time he was shot, but that Anthony Duke was outside when he pulled the trigger. Victim: Robert Hauser, 47, a tree-clipper who lived alone on a secluded Iosco Township property, was shot dead on New Years Eve 2011 . Scene: The murder occurred here at Hauser's remote Iosco Township house. Police allege Duke shot the victim from outside while he was standing in the basement . Duke allegedly lied to police about his whereabouts on the night of the murder, saying he was with his then-girlfriend, Ashley Coselman. However Coselman told detectives Duke was not with her the entire time, and that he left for the period between 9pm and 10pm. Investigators allege Hauser was killed at 9.26pm because it was the time frozen on his watch, which they believe broke as he fell down from his wounds. Coselman also testified that, after the murder, Duke asked her to purchase a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun on his behalf in order 'to hand it over to Livingston County Sheriff's Department'. In Duke's truck, police say they found a manual on how to beat a polygraph test. They allege they found internet searches about polygraph tests on Coselman's computer as well. Coselman also said her and Duke would argue about money, but he would come up with cash when they needed it. Remote: Hauser's home was secluded on 11000 block of Roberts Road, near Farmer John's Lane . Investigators say that while Hauser's home had not been ransacked, there was an empty zip-lock baggie found on his dryer. Friends told police that Hauser would always carry the baggie, and was known to carry as much as $5,000 cash in it. The fact it was empty suggested cash had been stolen. However Duke's defense attorney, Rolland Sizemore, said police were scrambling. 'It really looks like they're stretching to make these counts stick to Mr. Duke,' the defense attorney said. Sizemore noted the lack of evidence, and said it was not possible for Duke to shoot Hauser from outside the home on the angle police have alleged. Sizemore also said the empty baggie cannot prove anything was stolen.

Twitter users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters and bypass 999 calls under proposals aimed at making communication with the UK's biggest fire service easier. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has said that it will explore the idea of setting up the world's first 999 emergency feed to ease pressure on the telephone service which takes more than 30million calls a year. The plans, which are part of the Brigade's Draft London Safety Plan, will not replace the 999 system. Help: Twitter users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters or less . But the plans have been slammed by union chiefs who believe that the idea could put lives at risk. Ian Leahair, Fire Brigades Union executive council member for London told the Independent: 'It is a ludicrous idea. 'It will inevitably lead to more hoax calls. They sound like something the London Fire Brigade has just blurted out.' Some Twitter users had already taken to the social networking site to report fires according to the LFB, and fire crews have previously used information and pictures tweeted by members of the public to help tackle emergencies. But fire chiefs have urged people to continue to dial 999 as their Twitter feed @LondonFire is not currently manned around the clock. The service will look at different social media, micro-blogging sites and smart-phone apps as alternatives to the current telephone system. It cites figures from Ofcom that suggest that the number of people talking on the phone is in decline and that 20 per cent of adults now use a smart phone. Emergency: Fire crews could soon come to your aid after a Twitter request for help . Not up and running: Fire chiefs have urged people to continue to dial 999 to report fires as its Twitter feed is not currently manned round the clock (file picture) Rita Dexter, Deputy Commissioner of London Fire Brigade, said: 'With over a billion people now using Facebook and half a billion using Twitter, it’s quite clear that social media is here to stay. 'The London Fire Brigade is the biggest fire service in the country and we think it’s important to look into ways to improve how we communicate with the public and how they can get in touch with us.' New idea: The plans are part of the LFB's Draft London Safety Plan . Although the Brigade has said it will work with other emergency services in London, both the London Ambulance Service and the Metropolitan Police distanced themselves from the idea and said that they have no plans to introduce a similar service. But the LFB said that cynics rubbished the idea of dialling 999 in an emergency when it was first introduced more than seven decades ago. Rita Dexter added: 'When it was first set up in 1935, people said that dialling 999 to report emergencies would never work. 'Today BT handles over 30 million emergency calls each year. 'It’s time to look at new ways for people to report emergencies quickly and efficiently and social media could provide the answer in the future.' The LFB currently uses Twitter to give real-time updates on developing incidents and Facebook to offer fire prevention and safety advice to Londoners. The plan will be subject to a public consultation next month.

{"id": 15396, "article": "Two centuries after handkerchiefs were dipped in the blood of the beheaded French king Louis XVI, scientists believe they have proved one such rag kept as a revolutionary souvenir contains his bloodstains. For years researchers have been trying to verify the claim that an ornately decorated calabash contained a blood sample of the king, who was guillotined in Paris on January 21, 1793. On that day Parisian Maximilien Bourdaloue joined the crowds as dipped a handkerchief into the blood left at the scene of the decapitation. Beheading: Louis XVI was killed in 1793, as depicted in this painting of him being led to the guillotine by Charles Benazech . Study: Blood found in the gourd, right, was compared to DNA of the mummified skull of Henri IV, left, which found a genetic link . He is then believed to have placed the fabric in the gourd, which has been in the hands of an Italian family for more than a century, and had it embellished. Two years ago, analysis of DNA taken from traces of blood found inside the gourd revealed a likely match for someone of Louis' description, including his blue eyes. But it was never able to be proved beyond doubt as at the time the team did not have DNA of any royal relation. But a team of experts from France and Spain, which has published its findings in the journal Forensic Science International, have conducted further research using genetic material from another gruesome artefact - a mummified head believed to belong to Louis' 16th century predecessor, Henri IV. Their research has uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by two men separated by seven generations, and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process. French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier said: 'This study shows that (the owners of the remains) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line. Proof: The research has proved the authenticity of the gruesome artefacts of both the blood sample of Louis XVI, left, and the mummified head of Henri IV, right . 'They have a direct link to one another through their fathers.' The revolution in which Louis and queen Marie-Antoinette lost their heads in public executions also saw mobs ransack the royal chapel at Saint-Denis, north of Paris, hauling ancient monarchs like Henri from their tombs and mutilating the remains which they tossed into pits. Research: The results of the study were published yesterday and presented during a press conference earlier in December . An individual was recorded to have rescued a severed head from the chaos. Long thought to belong to Henri, assassinated at the age of 57 by a Catholic fanatic in 1610, the head changed hands several times over the next two centuries, bought and sold at auction or kept in secretive private collections. Scientists in 2010 said they found proof that the head was indeed Henri's, citing physical features that matched 16th century portraits of the king, as well as radiocarbon dating, 3D scanning and X-rays. The 2010 study, however, found no DNA and its findings have been contested by some. With the new evidence, 'it is about 250 times more likely that the (owners of the) head and the blood are paternally related, than unrelated,' according to co-author Carles Lalueza Fox of the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva in Barcelona. He said it would be 'extremely surprising' if the remains did not belong to the two monarchs, when all the physical and forensic evidence was taken together. Mr Charlier said: 'One can say that there is absolutely no doubt anymore.' The DNA data obtained from Louis XVI could now be used to decipher the genetic code of France's last absolute monarch and his living relatives.", "reference": "Research solves 220 year mystery of Louis XVI remains in calabash .\nHandkerchief dipped in blood of beheaded king kept in gourd since 1793 .\nScientists compared DNA in gourd with mummified head of king's ancestor ."}

Jeremy Manieri, 31, was wanted by Waveland, Mississippi, police in connection with the Rev. Edward Everitt's death Sunday, said Donna Wood, a Polk County Sheriff's officer. \"Mr. Manieri was one of the last people ... that we know of to see Father Everitt,\" said Waveland Police Chief James Varnell. \"We believe that his motive is robbery.\" Everitt, 70, was found dead Monday in the Dominican Retreat house in Waveland, Varnell said. He presided over the Holy Ghost Catholic Church in Hammond, Louisiana. \"This tragic loss of Father Ed's life leaves a deeply felt void in all our lives,\" said Bishop Robert Muench of Baton Rouge. Everitt was spending a few days of vacation at the Waveland house, which had been rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina, said a statement from the Southern Dominican Province, an order of friars. Everitt and Manieri had met two weeks before the death in Waveland. Everitt was going to hire Manieri to do a construction project there, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. Judd said police got a \"very detailed confession\" out of Manieri upon his arrest. Sunday, Manieri and Everitt argued in the Waveland house, according to the confession, Judd said. Manieri found a firearm and shot Everitt twice. Manieri took Everitt's wallet and his vehicle, a 2011 silver GMC HHR, then called his ex-wife, Judd said. Manieri told his ex-wife he was working on an oil rig and would take her, her son and his daughter to Disney World in Florida when he got his first paycheck, Judd said. The family left Sunday night after the homicide, stopping in Mobile, Alabama, for one evening. Manieri and the family arrived in Polk County, about an hour southwest of Orlando, early Tuesday and stopped at a Days Inn, Judd said. The family had planned to buy three-day passes to Disney on Tuesday, he said. Police found the suspect by tracking Everitt's stolen vehicle, pinpointing it within 20 minutes via a GPS tracking system. Around 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Polk County SWAT team arrested Manieri. \"Quite frankly, he left a trail of evidence that a blind man could've followed,\" Judd said. Varnell said Manieri had a long history with the police department, including a child molestation charge in 2005, which he was convicted of in October 2006. Judd said Manieri was booked in the Polk County Jail for Tuesday night and Waveland police could take Manieri into custody as soon as Wednesday. \"Fr. Ed was a man of great energy, both preaching and caring for others,\" said a statement from the Southern Dominican Province. \"(He) will be profoundly missed by his blood family, his Dominican family and all whom he has served as a Dominican and priest over his many years of ministry.\" A mass was held Tuesday in Hammond at 7 p.m. at the Holy Ghost Catholic Church in memory of Everitt.

Stephen Doran, 57, has been charged by police after he was found with a package believed to contain almost half a kilo of the drug which had been sent to his school in suburban Boston via the US Postal Service. When he appeared in court, bald-headed Doran's lawyer said he has undergone months of chemotherapy for stage three cancer. 'His life was on the line - literally,' he said. In court: Police said they caught math teacher Stephen Doran, 57, with almost half a kilo of methamphetamine . Accused: Doran is accused of having a large package of the drug sent to the school via the US Postal Service . Evidence: Police say they found more drugs, $10,000 in cash, digital scales and 'other items consistent with drug distribution' at Doran's home . The case bears a remarkable resemblance the plotline of award-winning TV series Breaking Bad, in which high school chemistry teacher Walter White begins producing and dealing meth after being diagnosed with cancer. In the show, Mr White - played by actor Bryan Cranston - uses the money to pay for medical bills and support his family believing he has only months to live. Police said Stephen Doran left Match Charter Middle School at around 12.30pm on Tuesday after receiving a large package. When he was pulled over by state troopers they recovered two heat-sealed bags of a crystalline substance which analysts say is consistent with methamphetamine. Police said they were acting on a tip-off and that the drugs had a street value of around $50,000. A search of Doran's home revealed $10,000 in cash, a digital scale and 38 additional grams of a similar substance. The Emmy award-winning TV series starring Bryan Cranston, revolves around the life of Walter White. The middle-aged chemistry teacher had the chance to be a brilliant academic but chose instead to work in a high school. At home he has wife who nags him constantly and a brother-in-law who works for the Drug Enforcement Agency and never ceases to let Walter know he is the alpha male of the family. Then he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and everything changes. Walter encounters an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, who happens to be a local methamphetamine dealer. Using his chemistry expertise, the pair set up as a producers and dealers of crystal meth. Walter's purpose appears to be solely to earn money to pay for his escalating medical bills and create a nest egg for his family after his death. But the change of career and the fear of his mortality also triggers much-deeper changes in this once placid character. The fifth and final season of Breaking Bad will run in the US from August 11.

'All I wanted was an easy life': Robert Moffat said he wished he had never won the lottery after he avoided prison for drink driving at a court hearing in Falkirk today . A lottery winner who blew all his money said today he wished he had never won the prize as he revealed he was now too poor even to pay a court fine for drink-driving. Robert Moffat - one of Scotland's first big winners - escaped a jail term after being caught more than five times the legal limit behind the wheel of his father's car. Moffat scooped £800,000 in 1996 - his share of a bumper £3.5million win divided among family members - but Falkirk Sheriff Court heard he now lives on benefits and can't afford to pay any financial penalty. After being ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work, and being banned from the road for five years, Moffat said he wished he had never won the money. The former barman, 51, said outside court: 'I had a much easier life before this happened. It was much less stressful. 'I just had a normal life, and had worked in the pub trade for over 19 years, just working away. 'After my win, everyone was chasing me for money, even the banks. There was obviously the high-profile paternity test as well. 'If I could go back to my life I would. I wish I'd never won this to be honest. All I wanted was an easy life.' When asked what he had spent the money on, he said: 'Houses, cars, holidays and diamonds. Frittered away: Lottery winner Robery Moffat pictured here with his TR6 car which he was asked to sell to pay for legal aid after spending his £800,000 win . 'I lived a good life for a while but £800,000 isn't a great deal when you spread it over 10 or so years. 'I just whittled it away, bit by bit. I had a pub in Denny, but I lost it two years ago, and have been unemployed since. 'It's been really difficult. All I really want is just a job. Any job really. I just want to get working again.' He said there was no in-fighting with the family members with who  he shared the winnings -his father Tom, his brother Jim, 56, and sister Anne, 59. He added: 'We don't discuss the money much. I don't know how much the rest of them still have. Fall from grace: Moffat poses with his wife, Michelle, by his house and luxury Range Rover. He has since lost all three and is now living off benefits . 'We keep ourselves to ourselves, but we get on when we see each other.' The former barman, who was happily married before the win, with a daughter, had surrounded himself with the trappings of wealth - a Range Rover stood in the driveway of his luxury bungalow while a lovingly-restored classic Triumph sports car gleamed in the garage. Both had personal registration plates. However, the court heard he had lost it all, including his wife, Michelle. Mark Keane, prosecuting, said that a member of the public phoned the police at 5pm on December 30 last year, after seeing a car which had crashed into a pavement bollard at Northfield Rd, Denny. The driver was confirmed as Moffat - at the wheel of his father's X-type Jaguar. Mr Keane said: 'As he approached the locus, he lost control, striking a bollard on the pavement. As a result, the front of the car was damaged. Happier times: Robert Moffat, and his former wife Michelle and their daughter Danielle on holiday at Disney, before he lost his lottery win and turned to benefits . 'The member of the public saw the car with the engine still running. The sole occupant of the car got out and walked off up the road.' He added: 'The witness was of the opinion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol and he reported the matter to police.' Moffat was traced and taken to a police station where he admitted it was his father's car and apologised. Moffat, of Braes View, Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted driving with an alcohol count of 186 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35. His pleas of not guilty to two further charges - failing to give information to the police as to who was the driver, and failing to cooperate with a preliminary breath test - were accepted by the Crown. Ban: Robert Moffat arrives at Falkirk Sheriff Court where he was banned from driving for five years and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work . Defence solicitor Dick Sandeman said: 'Mr Moffat has had a particularly hard time over the past year or so. 'He lost everything he had in his business and his wife and he split up. 'He has a drink difficulty.' Sheriff Thomas McCartney said only Moffat's lack of recent offending made him decide against a jail term. He said: 'That someone should drive a car with such a high level of alcohol is absolutely outrageous.' After Moffat won the Lottery a  former girlfriend claimed that he was the father of her son from a short-lived affair. He found himself in court defending a bitter paternity action, but the case was thrown out when DNA tests proved Moffat could not be the boy's father. Speaking at the time Moffat said: 'It's not pleasant being in the papers all the time just because people are jealous of my money and my nice cars.' Mr Moffat Snr also had post lottery problems. He married Emily Mitchell, who was 24 years his junior, and the pair ended up in the divorce courts after it was claimed he could not afford a £90,000 settlement because he had given away so much of his winnings to family, charity - and spent a lot on her during the marriage.

Doctors were unable to save the limb, which had to be amputated, but CSgt Spencer, formerly of 3 Commando Brigade, has now dedicated his life to helping others, having raised thousands of pounds for charity before his accident. Speaking for the first time about the  incident, the married father-of-two said: 'I was extremely close to death, but now I’m in this position where I’m just glad to be here today. 'Now I just want to help people.' CSgt Spencer had been driving on the M3 through Surrey on January 5 when he spotted hazard lights flashing in the distance. He could see a BMW had collided with the central reservation, and was partially blocking the middle and outside lanes. 'My immediate thought was well, I’m a first aider, if anyone is left in that car they are in mortal danger and I need to get them out,' he said. 'I pulled over onto the hard shoulder. Caring: CSgt Spencer, pictured with his wife Claire and children Billy and Harriet, says he has 'no excuses but to get on with life', and wants to use his experiences to help others . Staying positive: CSgt Spencer spent five weeks in hospital, and is now undergoing rehabilitation at Devonport Naval Base’s Hasler Company . 'There I saw two men and a woman who were originally in the car, and another person who had stopped to help. 'I made sure they were okay, and that no-one was left in the car. 'I then walked about 200 metres up the hard shoulder using my phone as a torch to try and make drivers aware of the accident.' CSgt Spencer said he then remembers hearing a loud 'bang' before the sound of people screaming. He was then hit by something, which he at first thought was a car. In fact, an Audi had collided at speed with the BMW and the force of the impact between the two cars was so great that the engine of the BMW was thrown from the vehicle. CSgt Spencer said the engine hurtled 70 metres across the lanes of the motorway, striking him with full force. In action: CSgt Spencer, pictured in Afghanistan, completed three tours in the country, as well as serving in Northern Ireland and Iraq . The impact knocked him several metres from the hard shoulder, over the barrier, and onto a grass verge. 'I came to a stop, and I was thinking I could feel myself moving and I could hear people screaming,' he said. 'I looked down and saw my left leg at right angles to my body, my right leg was barely still attached. 'I guess it was my training because I started shouting ‘medic, medic’ without thinking where I was. Lifeline: CSgt Spencer with wife of 21 years, Claire (left), and receiving a police commendation alongside Frank and Zanele Sibindi (right), who helped to save his life . 'I could see I had a catastrophic bleed in my right leg. I knew from my medical training that I had to stop the bleeding fast. 'I knew I had four to six minutes before I was dead. I could feel the symptoms of shock coming on.' CSgt Spencer’s wife, Claire, said her injured husband had called her from the roadside. 'He rang me and said he’d been in an accident, and then hung up - he later said he didn’t want me to just get a knock at the door with someone bringing the news,' said the 47-year-old. Charitable: Even before his accident, CSgt Spencer was a keen charity fundraiser, and raised £11,000 by running a 52-mile double marathon . Kind hearted: He ran the back-to-back marathons in aid of Dominic Lovett - a former Royal Marine also from Horrabridge - who was paralysed from the neck down in an accident while on exercise in Norway . Determined: CSgt Spencer also ran a marathon across Dartmoor, which took him nine hours due to a severe snow storm hitting the high moor . 'Apparently he was telling people how to save his life. That was the Royal Marine training in him. 'Everyone was panicking and he was just so calm telling people how to tie a tourniquet using a belt. 'He even helped the paramedics when they arrived. 'It’s unbelievable really but that’s how Lee is.' When he came around from his medically-induced coma in the Intensive Care Unit at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, CSgt Spencer was told that doctors had been forced to amputate his right leg. While being treated at the Headley Court rehabilitation centre earlier this year, a Warrant Officer suggested Csgt Spencer attend an event supporting Royal Marines  completing the final phase of their ‘1664 Challenge’. As part of the event, the six marines took on a moonlit 30-mile march from Greenwich to London, and Prince Harry was there to wish the marines good luck. 'I planned to do a sponsored one-mile walk, leading them on the first mile,' said CSgt Spencer. 'After I finished I met Prince Harry and his first question to me was \"why wasn’t I doing the whole 30 miles\". 'I don’t think he realised I had only lost my leg six months previously, and had only been out of a wheelchair for a month.' CSgt Spencer completed the mile in 19 minutes and 38 seconds, and has so far raised more than £7,000. His left leg had been dislocated and had to be totally reconstructed, while CSgt Spencer was told he had lost more than half of the blood in his body. He spent five weeks in hospital, and is now undergoing rehabilitation at Devonport Naval Base’s Hasler Company. Mrs Spencer said her husband is a true hero in every since of the word. 'He’s served in Afghanistan three times, as well as tours in Northern Ireland and Iraq,' added Mrs Spencer, who works for West Devon Borough Council. 'He’s served his country. 'He comes back unscathed from war, and then loses his leg on leave while helping someone. 'He just amazes me. 'We’ve been together for 28 years, and married for 21 years, and he’s always amazed me. 'He is inspirational to others - a lot of others - but to me and our children he’s just amazing. 'He has dark days, which is understandable, but he just gets up and gets on with it.' Csgt Spencer, whose bravery has been recognised with nominations for the Pride of Plymouth, and Pride of Britain Awards, said he was 'lucky to be alive'. 'It has been hard and I wouldn’t recommend it,' he said. 'It’s been far from a totally negative experience. 'I’ve done three tours of Afghanistan, and an untold amount of patrols. 'Every soldier who has done that and gone outside the gate, you’ve mentally prepared yourself for an injury like this. 'I think that mentality is still in me. Bizarrely it wasn’t a massive shock for this to happen to me. 'I look at other marines like Plymouth marine Mark Ormrod who lost both his legs and an arm and they’ve been in a worse position than me. 'I feel like I have no excuse but to get on with my life. You can’t just wallow in self pity.' Joining forces: CSgt Spencer joined fellow Royal Marines for a one mile sponsored walk through London . Even before his accident, CSgt Spencer was a keen charity fundraiser and last year raised £11,000 by running two back to back marathons in aid of Dominic Lovett - a former Royal Marine also from Horrabridge - who was paralysed from the neck down in an accident while on exercise in Norway. He also raised £2,000 through running a marathon over Dartmoor, which took him nine hours due to a severe snow storm hitting the high moor. While in hospital recovering from his injuries he began planning his future fundraising efforts, and is considering undertaking a variety of challenges. 'Crazy things like swimming the Channel, running a marathon and using what happened to me in a positive way,' he said. 'My main aim is to continue with the rehab and I want to use the experience to help others. 'I’ve loved my time as a Royal Marine. When I look back what I have enjoyed so much is the service; there is something meaningful in service - it is very much a part of me.'", "reference": "Lee Spencer, 45, had stopped to help  driver on the M3 in Surrey .\nAs he tried to warn oncoming traffic another car hit the stricken Audi .\nCrash impact forced Audi's engine from the car and it hit Colour Sergeant .\nFather-of-two's right leg was severed and had to be amputated by doctors .\nHe plans to use his experience to help others, and raise money for charity ."}
{"id": 15403, "article": "Eating fruit and grains is an important step for boosting male fertility . Cutting down on red meat, coffee and alcohol can boost a man's fertility scientists say. A study has discovered that a poor diet and obesity can lower sperm concentration and affect their ability to swim towards an egg. Specialists are now encouraging a diet high in fruit and grains to increase the chances of successful IVF treatment. In the past female fertility problems have been linked to obesity as well . as smoking and drinking, but it hasn't been clear before now if the same . applies to men. But the latest study of men with partners who were undergoing a type of fertility treatment, has revealed that those who regularly drank alcohol and ate poorly were slowed down on the fertility front. Lead researcher Edson Borges, from the Fertility-Assisted Fertilization Center in Sao Paolo said: 'The sperm concentration was negatively . influenced by body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption, and was . positively influenced by cereal consumption and the number of meals per . day.' The Brazilian study involved 250 men with partners who were undergoing a type of fertility treatment called . intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Each participant was asked how often they ate a range of foods, including fruits and . vegetables, beans, grains, meat and fish, as well as how much they drank . and smoked. Semen samples were then analysed to . assess sperm health and concentration and each couple were monitored . during the  IVF process. Specialists are now encouraging a diet high in fruit and grains to increase the chances of successful IVF treatment . Eggs were successfully fertilised in . about three-quarters of the treatments, and just under forty per cent of women . got pregnant during the study. From the speed of their sperm to their . partner's chance of pregnancy, men who drank and had a poor diet were less fertile. Lynn Westphal, a women's health . and fertility specialist at Stanford University hopes that the results, published in the Fertility and Sterility journal, will encourage men to make healthier lifestyle choices. 'We talk about having a healthy . lifestyle and trying to eliminate any of these things that are bad for . health, but I think most of the emphasis tends to be on making sure the . woman is as healthy as possible. 'I think this is really interesting data . that lifestyle factors for men, even when you're doing ICSI, are . significant. 'This is probably more of a difference than most people . would have thought.'", "reference": "Specialists say diet high in fruit and grains increases the chance of successful IVF treatment ."}

China is in 2013 set to make 19.6m cars and other light vehicles such as small trucks compared with 18.3m in Europe, according to projections prepared for the Financial Times by five forecasting groups. The rise of China is even more striking considering the projections for Europe include not just the European Union but other nations such as Russia and Turkey. In 2012, on the basis of motor industry estimates, Europe made 18.9m cars and related vehicles, comfortably ahead of China's tally of 17.8m. The projections are based on data from the IHS, LMC Auto and PwC consultancies together with investment banks UBS and Credit Suisse. They paint a picture of only a slight recovery in 2013 for the world car industry, where output is expected to climb by a muted 2.2 per cent in the coming year, as against 4.9 per cent in 2012. With global sales valued at about $1.3tn a year, the car industry is one of the best bellwethers of world economic conditions. According to the data, Europe will in 2013 make just over a fifth of the world's cars -- a figure that is well down on the 35 per cent it recorded in 2001. In 1970 nearly one in every two cars made in the world originated from a factory in Europe -- which is generally recognised as the place where the global auto industry began with the unveiling of a rudimentary three-wheeler in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz. Car production in China in 2013 is likely to be 10 times higher than in 2000 -- when its share of global auto manufacturing was just 3.5 per cent as opposed to a likely 23.8 per cent in 2013. Scott Corwin, an automotive expert at the Booz & Co consultancy, said that even with relatively strong growth projected in vehicle output and demand in both the US and China, \"these markets alone won't do much to pull [the whole world] forward\". Mr Corwin also cautioned that even with a continuation of the recent rise of the car industry in China, many vehicle markers doing business there \"are struggling to make much money\" as a result of tough competition and the fact that the market is made up of large numbers of small cars, for which profit margins for manufacturers are small. Europe's expected fall in production is in response to a steep decline in car sales throughout the continent since the 2008/09 financial crisis, with the problems causing severe difficulties at a number of large vehicle makers, notably France's PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n, which is cutting almost 10,000 jobs and is lining up a â‚¬7bn rescue package for its financing arm with the French government. Most car markers with strong positions in the European vehicle business are braced for a turbulent period ahead. Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of the German luxury carmaker BMW, said he expected conditions for selling cars in Europe would remain \"very challenging\" in 2013.

{"id": 15405, "article": "By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 10 June 2013 . The man behind one of the most significant leaks in U.S. history has revealed himself as a high school drop-out who turned against his government when he realized it was 'doing far more harm than good'. As Edward Snowden steps from the shadows to explain his reasons for leaking information from the National Security Agency, questions are emerging over how the failed student rose up the ranks to become gatekeeper of the government's biggest secrets. Snowden, 29, spoke to The Guardian from a hotel room in Hong Kong where he is on the run after leaking sensitive documents on how the NSA has gleaned personal data from internet companies. He had access to the NSA's top secrets after a steep rise . to work for government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, which paid him . $200,000 a year to work on the the agency's computer systems. The whistleblower: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, is pictured in Hong Kong after identifying himself as the man who leaked the agency's secrets . While there, the NSA let him see 'everything', he said - a baffling position considering his limited credentials. Snowden grew up in in Elizabeth City, . North Carolina, before later moving to Maryland, near the headquarters . of the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade. Public records show his mother is a government employee - a deputy clerk for the U.S. District Court in Maryland - the Washington Post reported. He took just a few 'computer' classes at a community college in a bid to get his high-school equivalency degree, yet he failed to complete them. Despite no qualifications, The Guardian, which interviewed him at a secret location, called him 'a master on computers' and 'happiest when talking about the technical side of surveillance'. As a teenager he dreamed of defending . the American Way as a soldier in the U.S. Army and began a training . program to join the Special Forces in 2003. He told The Guardian he wanted to . fight in the Iraq war because he felt he had an obligation as a human . being to help free people from oppression - the same reason he is giving . to justify his leaks. Far from home: The home in Waipahu, Hawaii, where Snowden lived with his girlfriend until recently . Edward Snowden has fled to Hong Kong, which is a gamble, but the country's free speech laws mean he does have a slim chance of avoiding being swept back to America if the government demand he returns. Hong Kong signed an extradition treaty with the United States in 1997, just before Britain handed it back to China. In it both agreed to send fugitives back and forth in the majority of cases, but there were also political exemptions negotiated at the time. Hong Kong has the 'right of refusal when surrender implicates the \"defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy'' of the People's Republic of China'. China itself has no extradition treaty with America at all. Hong Kong officials also have the right to say no to extradition if they believe that the attempt is 'politically motivated'. This means that they will protect free speech if a person is being arrested just for their political opinions. The United States may have already approached Interpol or its consulate in Hong Kong to start proceedings. They will use the Espionage Act to gain warrants for his arrest. Hong Kong's authorities can hold Snowden for 60 days, following a U.S. request that includes probable cause, while Washington prepares a formal extradition request. 'I think it is really tragic that an American has to move to a place that has a reputation for less freedom,' he told The Guardian. But he was stunned when he began his training. 'Most of the people training us seemed pumped up about killing Arabs, not helping anyone,' he said. After he broke both his legs in a training accident, he was discharged. The Guardian added that Snowden had tried to join the elite special forces but had been unsuccessful. Records show he enlisted in the army reserve as a special forces recruit in May 2004 and was discharged that September. An army spokesman told the Guardian that he did not complete any training or receive any awards. He got his first NSA job working as a . security guard at one of the agency's facilities at the University of . Maryland before moving to the CIA to work on IT security. There, he rose . quickly, making a bizarrely large leap to having access to more and more top-secret documents as he climbed the ranks. On its hiring site, the NSA says each role requires a different application process. But it says that applicants 'can expect their hiring process to include medical screening, a polygraph interview, drug test, and an extensive background investigation'. It adds that the background check helps determine the person's 'honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, and unquestioned loyalty to the United States' and requires interviews with family and colleagues. It is unknown which checks Snowden underwent before his job as a security guard, and whether these checks were repeated as he rose through the ranks. The NSA does give hiring preference to former military, according to its website. In 2007, the CIA . stationed him with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was . responsible for maintaining computer network security and privy to more . secrets than ever before. Despite his lackluster resume, he was not only privy to the agency's surveillance systems, he also had the ability to use them, he told the Guardian in a video interview. 'I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the . authorities [sic] to wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a . federal judge to even the president if I had a personal email,' he said. After soaring up the ranks at . the NSA and then as a contractor, he said there came a moment when he . realized his government was 'doing more harm than good'. Surveillance: Policemen stand outside the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong; Snowden fled to the country after releasing information about the NSA to The Guardian newspaper but his location is unknown . 'Much . of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government . functions and what its impact is in the world,' he said. He told The Guardian of one incident . where CIA operatives got a Swiss banker drunk in an effort to recruit . him as an informant to obtain secret banking information. He said they encouraged him to drive . home intoxicated and when he was arrested for DUI, the undercover agents . offered to help, managing to recruit the banker on the back of the . favour. Snowden said this and other things he . witnessed in Geneva disillusioned him about how his government worked . and how this in turn impacted the world. 'I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good,' he said. He said he was disappointed President . Obama advanced the policies he was hoping the newly elected President . was stamp out and that 'hardened' him. Explaining why he decided to leave . the U.S., he said: 'I don't want to live in a society that does these . sort of things... I do not want to live in a world where everything I do . and say is recorded.' On the run: Visitors walk into The Mira Hotel, Snowden was reported to have checked out of on Monday . In hiding: Snowden is in Hong Kong, pictured, and said he does not expect ever to return home . Snowden was previously a technical officer for the CIA and worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) as an employee of Dell, a private contractor, before being hired by Booz Allen as an infrastructure analyst for the NSA in Hawaii. He said he was also stationed in Japan at one point. He worked as an infrastructure analyst for Booz Allen before telling his employers he needed to take a break for treatment for epilepsy. He told his girlfriend he needed to travel for work. In a statement, the company confirmed Snowden had been an employee for less than three months and had been assigned to a team in Hawaii. 'News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,' it said. Snowden said he was content to sever his 'very comfortable life', which included a six-figure salary, a girlfriend, a home in Hawaii and his family, to shine a light on the NSA's widening surveillance net. And while his decision to reveal his identity may seem strange considering the potential ramifications, he said: 'I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong.'", "reference": "Edward Snowden, 29, leaked details of PRISM, a National Security Agency program he says harvests personal data from internet .\nHe has fled to Hong Kong from Hawaii, where he worked as computer technician for government contractor on $200,000 a year salary .\nQuestions over how a man who failed to complete his high school education was entrusted with NSA's top secrets and systems .\nVideo interview courtesy of Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras at The Guardian ."}

{"id": 15408, "article": "One of Australia's top criminal prosecutors is trying to stop a corruption watchdog inquiry, investigating accusations that she advised her son's girlfriend to pretend to have chest pains after a car accident to avoid a blood alcohol test. NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, is understood to have launched legal action in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday against a planned Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry into the allegations. The action, which is expected to be heard in the coming days, will argue the inquiry falls outside the ICAC's jurisdiction. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is investigating whether Ms Cunneen and her son Stephen Wyllie, 26, advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid being breath tested after a car crash on May 31. NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen is considering quitting over a corruption investigation into a car crash involving her son's girlfriend . Sophia Tilley was involved in a car accident at Willoughby on May 31. Her boyfriend Stephen Wyllie is the son of Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC. Ms Cunneen and Mr Wylie are accused of counselling Ms Tilley to face chest pain at the crash site. The highly-respected has stood aside from her duties until the investigation is resolved. She revealed to Daily Mail Australia that she is considering quitting her job in response to what she says is a baseless corruption investigation targeting her and her son. 'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw,' Ms Cunneen told Daily Mail Australia. 'After 38 years in the service of our state.' The court challenge comes after former Supreme Court judge David Levine QC, who is now the Inspector of the ICAC, reportedly asked the commission to justify its inquiry into Ms Cunneen. Mr Levine's audit requires ICAC to hand over material related to the investigation. It's claimed she and her son Stephen Wyllie in May advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains to avoid a blood alcohol test at scene of a car crash. Ms Tilley allegedly took the advice. Ms Cunneen denies what she's described as the 'malicious' allegations made to the watchdog. Former Queensland Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Commissioner Alan MacSporran QC will preside over the three-day public inquiry starting on November 10, should Ms Cunneen's legal challenge be unsuccessful. Ms Cunneen, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, told Daily Mail Australia that she is devastated by the effect of the investigation on her family. Margaret Cunneen has had a distinguished 38-year career in public service. She is considering quitting due to allegations she and her son attempted to pervert the course of justice in relation to a car accident involving her son's girlfriend. ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August. Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo when she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore, on May 31. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time. Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured. 'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw.' Margaret Cunneen may quit her job as deputy senior Crown prosecutor . Deputy senior Crown prosecutor is accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice. She denies any wrongdoing and does not know who has been allegations against her . The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident. The Mondeo was a write-off. None of those at the crash scene knew of any investigation until ICAC officers executed simultaneous warrants on July 31 at the home of Ms Cunneen and that of Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley. Each of their mobile telephones was seized. Ms Cunneen has successfully prosecuted paedophiles Robert 'Dolly' Dunn, Colin Fisk and Phillip Bell as well as pack rapist Bilal Skaf and his gang of thugs. Despite, or because, of her accomplishments, she has been criticised by some defence lawyers for being too close to crime victims. In late 2012, Ms Cunneen was appointed to preside over a special commission of inquiry into allegations of police interference in child sex abuse cases in the Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle. The day before the accident she had delivered her report to the then Governor, Dame Marie Bashir. Ms Cunneen is unsure what happened in the two months between the accident and her phone being seized to initiate an investigation but believes the inquiry was sparked by a 'malicious complaint' from someone out to damage her reputation. She has stood aside from her job pending the outcome of the investigation. In August, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were called before ICAC for private hearings. Again, the matter seemed to be stalled until Mr Wyllie, Ms Tilley and Ms Cunneen were served with summonses to appear before a public hearing on Wednesday night. Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen says she may quit her job over ICAC's investigation into allegations she counselled her son Stephen Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to face chest pains after a car accident . The following day ICAC announced it would hold public hearings as part of what it is calling Operation Hale. The hearings would examine 'allegations that on 31 May 2014 Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC and Stephen Wyllie, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains, and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Ms Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident'. The public hearing is set for three days, staring on November 10, when the commission is expected to hear from police and ambulance officers who attended the crash as well as members of the public who were present at the scene. Daily Mail Australia can reveal that since the announcement of the public hearing a new witness to accident has come forward stating she heard and saw 'nothing untoward' at the crash scene. Ms Cunneen has received widespread support from prominent Australians, particularly in the legal community. The architect of the ICAC, Gary Sturgess, has described the investigation as 'appalling'. 'That's a joke, really that's a joke,' Mr Sturgess told The Daily Telegraph. 'If that is the best they have got to do then frankly they should be handing some money back. It's appalling.' Former premier Nick Greiner, who set up the ICAC in 1989, has also criticised the corruption watchdog's investigation into Ms Cunneen for straying beyond its 'core task'. Mr Greiner told The Sydney Morning Herald he had a 'sneaking view' that if Ms Cunneen had a lower profile 'I doubt this would have happened'.", "reference": "Margaret Cunneen, SC, launches legal action in the NSW Supreme Court .\nThe top criminal prosecutor is seeking to hault a planned ICAC inquiry .\nShe has been accused of counselling her son's girlfriend to fake chest pain after a car accident on May 31 .\nShe has successfully prosecuted some of the country's worst pack rapists and paedophiles .\nICAC investigators seized her phone two months after the accident .\nMs Cunneen is now considering quitting her distinguished career due to the effect of an ICAC investigation on her family ."}
{"id": 15409, "article": "(CNN) -- In October 2011, actor Hugh Jackman launched a new company called Laughing Man. Initially, the business offered a variety of coffees and teas, sold online and in a small cafe in the Tribeca part of New York City. This week, Jackman's expanding his line of offerings into the world of chocolate, just in time for Valentine's Day. While it's certainly commonplace for entertainment professionals to dive into other business opportunities, Jackman's new business may seem a bit curious if viewed through the lens of his offering items tied to the little pleasures and relaxations of life. Jackman seems to always be shooting a film or booking theater work. The guy can't slow down. CNN recently spoke with the actor from London about the evolution of his new business, the inspiration behind it and who in his family is helping out. He's currently rehearsing for the upcoming film adaptation of \"Les MisÃ©rables\" and later this year will begin shooting \"The Wolverine,\" reprising his role as Logan/Wolverine in the latest comic adaptation. CNN: Some people claim that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. Some people don't. Does your chocolate guarantee good loving? Jackman: That's a good question. I would definitely say -- because I eat a little bit of dark chocolate every day -- I'd definitely say that it makes you feel good. I don't know if it makes me feel like \"getting it on.\" I suppose I could see the connection. It definitely makes you feel good. CNN: You launched Laughing Man last fall. In the general sense, what's the business plan? Jackman: Laughing Man worldwide is going to incubate different companies. One of them is coffee and tea, one of them is chocolate. Who knows where we'll go from there. Each of these companies that we create, 100% of the profits go to charities. It's first and foremost about creating good products that people really want. Not that they feel like they should want it, but because they genuinely want it. And then being able to create jobs and support entrepreneuralism. I was mainly inspired by Paul Newman on the business level and what he did. I read his book about 10 years ago, \"Shameless Exploitation in the Pursuit of the Common Good.\" It's a great book and that's probably where the idea incubated. CNN: The Newman line, and sorry for the pun, started very organically. Jackman: That's what inspired me, and I was waiting for the right opportunity. I was in Ethiopia as a part of World Vision and I met and worked with a coffee farmer, Dukale; at the time I was living with them, and it was pretty amazing. It had a great effect on me. So the urgency for me to do something was growing, but I didn't know what. Now, we actually buy coffee from Dukale where I stayed. Our Espresso blend is actually called Dukale's Dream. CNN: And everything is sourced with fair trade guidelines and all that? Jackman: Absolutely. Organic, fairly traded, the chocolates are kosher, you name it. We wanted to be win-win all around. The environment, the growers and the purchasers. CNN: There's a lot of political aspects surrounding food, not only in the U.S. but on a global level. But there's a market out there for people that care about that stuff. Jackman: Oh, yeah, hugely. And what's important for us to know who we are buying from. There's some organizations that you're buying from that are like a co-op and you can't really guarantee who you are buying from. We really want to encourage people that you can get a really fair price for quality products, wherever it's grown. That's what we're doing. Business done well is a win-win all around. It doesn't have to tax the environment or quality or the workers or people. There is a way, under the natural law, for this to work for everybody. CNN: As an actor, you're constantly busy with work. How much are you involved in the day-to-day or month-to-month of this? Jackman: Every weekend, I go down [to the store in New York City] with my son and do some work. He's 11. I figure it's good for him to start doing some work. Most of the business is done online. I'm involved as much as I can without it being my full-time job. For a long time, I've been looking to focus my profile on and this somehow ... I've always been interested in economics and business -- my wife always jokes that I should be taking a briefcase to work -- it's something I genuinely enjoy and it doesn't feel like a burden. CNN: You're rehearsing \"Les MisÃ©rables\" right now. What's the adaptation going to be like? Jackman: It's a musical adaptation. Obviously, it's a 1,500 page book, but don't worry, it's not going to be 15 hours long. It's an epic, and we'll be musically close to the musical. Today, I was working on a brand new song that Claude-Michel [SchÃ¶nberg] wrote with Alain Boublil, which was a great thrill for me. CNN: What's the sound like? Is it modern in any way? Jackman: Oh, no, the music is largely as it is from the musical. So there's no rap version or blues version. It's going to be what people expect in that way. CNN: 20th Century Fox just announced a release date for \"The Wolverine.\" What's the game plan? Jackman: Shooting later this year. \"Les Mis\" finishes around the beginning of June so we'll take a month down and we'll get started. It's a Japanese saga, I'm very excited about it. It's looking good.", "reference": "Hugh Jackman's expanding his Laughing Man line into the world of chocolate .\n\"I eat a little bit of dark chocolate every day,\" Jackman said .\nJackman: \"Business done well is a win-win all around\""}
{"id": 15410, "article": "As Liverpool crashed out of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday evening, a familiar scapegoat emerged. Mario Balotelli took much of the immediate blame for failing to properly mark Branislav Ivanovic, allowing the Serbian defender a free header from seven yards out. As Willian prepared to whip in a free kick in the first period of extra-time, Balotelli was seen grabbing Ivanovic's shirt as Liverpool got in to their defensive shape. Branislav Ivanovic rises to head Chelsea 1-0 in front against Liverpool on Tuesday night . Ivanovic was initially being marked by Mario Balotelli but lost him to get a free header in the box . A few seconds later, however, Ivanovic had drifted behind his marker and fired in what turned out to be the winning goal in Chelsea's 1-0 victory. But was Balotelli solely to blame? Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher disagrees, instead highlighting faults in Liverpool's zonal marking system. Steven Gerrard, Lucas, Balotelli all line up in front of Chelsea's first attacker Ivanovic . As Willian takes his free-kick, Ivanovic moves behind his original marker Balotelli . Gerrard and Lucas are marking 'zones' with no Chelsea players in them due to poor positioning . Balotelli moves forward as Diego Costa goes into his 'zone' 'It's not Mario's fault the goal! In zonal defence you attack the space in front of you! Costa goes in front of him so he goes with him,' Carragher wrote on kicca. 'The fault initially is Gerrard, Lucas & Mario should all come back 3 yards so Stevie is in Lucas position etc. 'As Willian takes it there are 3 Chelsea players between Mario & Johnson/Skrtel that's the problem those 2 are wrong side so there's too much space for them to run into.' Indeed, replays of the goal seem to back up Carragher's assertions as Steven Gerrard and Lucas's starting position mean Willian's ball drifts completely past them into an area where Chelsea's players have plenty of room to run in to. As Liverpool line up to to defend the free-kick, Jordan Henderson is marking Diego Costa . But as the ball comes in to the box, Henderson fails to track Costa's run . Henderson's is left back near the penalty spot, while Costa has moved into Balotelli's zone . Balotelli jumps with Costa, leaving Ivanovic with a free header to score . In effect, Gerrard and Lucas were defending 'zones' they did not need too as Chelsea had no players in or attacking that space. Therefore, as Carragher says, Liverpool's line should have moved three yards back. Balotelli, meanwhile, can be seen stepping forward and challenging Diego Costa as the Chelsea striker moves into his 'zone' after losing his marker Jordan Henderson. Had Henderson stayed with Costa then Balotelli may not have had to step forward and may have been better positioned to challenge Ivanovic. Balotelli must take responsibility for his lack of movement during his brief cameo at Stamford Bridge, but to blame him for the goal - is that really fair?", "reference": "Mario Balotelli was initially marking Branislav Ivanovic from free-kick .\nBut Liverpool striker lost his man, allowing him to score the winning goal .\nBut Jamie Carragher defends  Balotelli saying problems lie in zonal system .\nChelsea booked their place at Wembley with 1-0 win over Liverpool .\nClick here for more Liverpool news ."}

{"id": 15412, "article": "(CNN) -- Elena Bonner, the wife of late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov who gained worldwide acclaim after smuggling her husband's writings out of exile, died Saturday in Boston, her daughter said in a statement. She was 88. Bonner's ashes are be interred at a Moscow cemetery next to her late husband's remains, said her daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich. Bonner's life revolved around the political struggles that characterized the Soviet Union in the 20th century. She joined forces with Sakharov in the early 1970's. Bonner was born in 1923 in Turkmenistan into a family of prominent Communist Party officials, according to a biography posted on Harvard University's website. Her father was killed in Stalin's purges during the \"Great Terror\" of the late 1930s, and her mother was interned in a gulag for 10 years. Bonner was twice wounded during World War II while serving as a nurse for the Soviet military. She became a physician after the war. She married Sakharov, known for his work on the development of the atomic bomb for the Soviet Union, in 1972, according to the Andrei Sakharov Foundation website. Following his work on the atomic bomb, Sakharov began publishing writings critical of Soviet politics. Bonner followed Sakharov into exile in Gorky, in western Russia, in 1980. She was permitted to take trips to Moscow, which enabled her to smuggle Sakharov's critical writings on the Soviet Union out of exile. Bonner was convicted of \"anti-Soviet agitation\" in 1984 for smuggling Sakharov's writings and lost her travel privileges to Moscow. She was confined to Gorky with her husband. Mikhail Gorbachev ended Bonner and Sakharov's exile in 1986 by inviting them to return to Moscow, according to the Andrei Sakharov Foundation. Bonner, a founding member of the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1976, received the Rafto Prize in 1991 for her promotion of human rights in the former Soviet Union and contemporary Russia, according to the foundation. She moved to the United States to be with her daughter after Sakharov's death in 1989. She published at least four books on her life as a dissident, according to the Harvard website. \"It is with great sadness that I heard\" of Bonner's passing, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a statement, describing her as a human rights activist and author. \"She stood side by side with her husband in the fight for political freedom, democracy and human rights in the former Soviet Union, and all over the world. I want to pay tribute to the courage she showed in standing up for fundamental freedoms and human dignity that people worldwide demand.\"", "reference": "European Commission president pays tribute to Bonner's \"courage\"\nBonner's father, a prominent Communist, had been purged in dictator Joseph Stalin's \"Great Terror\"\nHer mother spent years in a gulag .\nMikhail Gorbachev personally ended Bonner and Sakharov's exile ."}

{"id": 15414, "article": "By . Amanda Williams . An investigation has been launched after a social worker took the wrong child out of school for a supervised visit with another boy’s father. Four-year-old Kenzie Joe Jubb was removed from his nursery classroom, and sent with a stranger to ‘see his father’ - along with a two-year-old girl they mistakenly thought was his sister. He was away from his class at Francis Askew Primary School in Hull, East Yorkshire for more than 10 minutes and driven to social services offices before teachers realised the mistake. Four-year-old Kenzie Joe Jubb was removed from his nursery classroom at Francis Askew Primary School in Hull, East Yorkshire, and sent with a stranger to 'see his father' - along with a two-year-old girl they mistakenly thought was his sister . Now, his parents are demanding a full explanation as to why Kenzie, who has no dealings with social services, was taken. His father Alistair Jubb said: 'We are furious. The school CCTV shows him being away for 11 minutes, but 11 minutes is a long time when your son is with someone he doesn’t know. 'How did they get the wrong child? We want to know exactly how this has happened. 'I am absolutely furious with the school. The head has assured me this will never happen again, but I wouldn’t have ever expected it to happen in the first place. 'Somebody has messed up somewhere along the line and we want to know who it was and how it happened.' The school contacted the city council’s Safeguarding Children Board when they realised the error and an investigation is being carried out. Mr Jubb said: 'The school called his mum and she was distraught. When she called me, all sorts went through my head. 'She said Kenzie had been taken out of school and the first thing that went through my head was that it was someone with a fake identification. 'It was horrific. His mum said he was back in school and those feelings of horror turned to anger.' Mr Jubb said Kenzie was taken with a social worker who also had a two-year-old girl - the sister of the child who was meant to be taken from the school. Mr Jubb said: 'I asked Kenzie if he had got in the car and where they took him. 'He said he was put in the car and the social worker told him he would be going to a house where there was a dog and he would be seeing his dad. 'He is only four. He was confused. He was taken by someone who he has never seen before in his life.' Kenzie was driven to social services offices before the mistake was discovered.

{"id": 15415, "article": "The investigation into Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is now classified as a criminal investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing the Malaysian police chief. Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said authorities have already recorded more than 170 statements and will interview more people for the Flight 370 probe, the Journal said. But Bakar cautioned that what happened with Flight 370 might still be unknown after the investigation. He added that the investigation into the flight simulator in the pilot's house is still inconclusive. Authorities are awaiting an expert's report on the simulator, he said. After three and a half weeks, the search for the missing plane has come down to this: a lot of floating rubbish, hundreds of heartbroken relatives and, now, quibbling over words all acknowledge offer no clues into what happened to the doomed plane. Malaysian authorities on Tuesday released the transcript of radio chatter between air traffic controllers and the plane in the hour or so before it vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8 with 239 people on board. The transcript shows the last voice transmission from the doomed plane was \"Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero\" -- not the \"All right, good night\" transmission authorities had previously used. The comments are \"exactly what you'd expect\" in a cockpit, airline safety expert John Gadzinski told CNN's \"The Lead.\" Still, even if this new transcript offers no clues about the plane's mysterious disappearance, the discrepancy has provided fresh fodder for critics of Malaysia's handling of the investigation. Read the cockpit transcript . That authorities gave one version and let it stand uncorrected for weeks undermines confidence in the investigation, air accident investigation experts told CNN. \"High criticism is in order at this point,\" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. And Michael Goldfarb, a former chief of staff at the Federal Aviation Administration, added that people following the investigation \"haven't had a straight, clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in.\" \"We have the tragedy of the crash, we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here,\" he said. Malaysian officials have defended their work, with acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein recently saying, \"History will judge us well.\" Regardless of one's assessment of Malaysia's response, that doesn't change the immense challenge it faces -- especially given the few apparent details on altitude, speed and, of course, location. \"They are looking in a vast area in very deep waters, ... and we really have no idea where it went in,\" Bill Schofield, an Australian scientist who helped create flight data recorders that could be key in determining what happened, told CNN. \"... A needle in a haystack would be much easier to find.\" Inside the flight simulator . Search 'could drag on' After refocusing their search Friday to a new patch of Indian Ocean hundreds of miles from where they had been looking, authorities still haven't found anything definitively linked to Flight 370. Ten aircraft and nine ships crisscrossed a 46,000-square-mile (120,000-square-kilometer) search zone on Tuesday. With so many planes in the skies over the search zone, Australia sent an airborne air traffic control plane to guard against accidents. The search zone for Wednesday shifted eastward toward the Australian coast from what it had the day before, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. While this means new territory will be covered, officials caution against expecting an imminent breakthrough. \"It will take time,\" retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the head of the Australia's new Joint Agency Coordination Centre, said Tuesday. \"It's not something that's necessarily going to be resolved in the next two weeks.\" The plane disappeared over the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, after signing off with Malaysian controllers, but before checking in with their counterparts in Vietnam. Authorities don't know what happened on board after that, but radar and satellite data show the plane turned off course and flew back across Malaysia before turning south over the Indian Ocean. Based on sophisticated analysis of satellite data, investigators believe it went down in the southern Indian Ocean, but they can't pinpoint a location. A Malaysian government source told CNN on Monday that the airliner's turn off course is being considered a \"criminal act,\" either by one of the pilots or someone else. In a background briefing given to CNN, Malaysian investigators said they believed the plane was \"flown by someone with good flying knowledge of the aircraft.\" A senior Malaysian government official last week told CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes that authorities have found nothing in days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive, be it political, suicidal or extremist. \"It's one of the great mysteries of our time,\" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a radio interview Wednesday from Perth, where he'll host his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak later in the day. \"...We owe it to the world, we owe it to those families to do whatever we reasonably can do get to the bottom of this.\" More help on the way . Chinese relatives of passengers got a chance Wednesday to learn how the search is unfolding and how it's been concluded that the flight ended in the Indian Ocean. Malaysia Airlines and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation led a closed-door briefing with the Chinese kin in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian government said. Technical experts from Malaysia, China and Australia were also expected to participate, as was the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia. Meanwhile, even more assets are contributing to the search. Hishammuddin tweeted the HMS Tireless, a British nuclear submarine, will take part. It'll be joined by an Australian ship with a pinger locator designed to listen for locator beacons attached to the plane's flight data recorder plus a submersible capable of canvassing the ocean floor for wreckage. Both pieces of technology come from the U.S. Navy. The equipment won't be of any use, however, until searchers are able to find wreckage from the plane to help narrow the search zone. That's because neither the pinger locator nor the submersible can quickly scan the enormous area being searched. Under the best of sea conditions, the pingers can be heard 2 nautical miles away. But high seas, background noise, wreckage or silt can all make pingers harder to detect. It will take the ship, the Ocean Shield, two more days just to get to the search zone, leaving precious little time to locate the flight data recorders before the batteries on its locator beacon run out. Time is running out: The batteries are designed to last 30 days. Wednesday is the 26th day that authorities have been looking for the plane. There's no guarantee it will be found anytime soon. For all the expertise and technology, there's still more unknown about Flight 370 than is known about it -- including its altitude, precise speed and, especially, its final resting place.

The hospital's senior professor of surgery, Bahadir Bebezov,said: 'The parents brought her in after she started losing weight, and she couldn't eat anything. 'By the time we got her, she couldn't even drink water. We realised we needed to operate immediately. 'It was actually the only alternative, nothing else would solve the problem. 'In fact, her stomach was so badly swollen from hair and bits of wool from the carpet that it literally just oozed out soon as the wall of the stomach was cut.' He added: 'Psychologically, apart from a habit of picking up hair from the carpet and eating it, the young girl was perfectly normal and healthy. 'She also chewed the tips of her hair.' Miss Alekseeva, who is now recovering from surgery and will return home shortly, has now promised never to chew her hair in the future. The surgeons who operated on the 18-year-old say they can find no evidence of such a large hairball in the last 50 years of medical literature .", "reference": "Ayperi Alekseeva, had spent years eating hair picked up from the carpet .\n18-year-old, Kyrgyzstan, also chewed the tips of her hair, say doctors .\nBy the time huge blockage was discovered, she couldn't eat or drink .\nSo dehydrated and malnourished that she would have died without surgery .\nDoctors say medical records indicate no bigger hairball in past 50 years .\nWARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT ."}

In a sales pitch gone wrong, a pilot salesman was lucky to escape uninjured alongside his two passengers after the aircraft he was flying crashed into a backyard. The pilot, 62-year-old Peter Edwards according to the Daily Telegraph, was demonstrating how the Cirrus SR22 aircraft he was flying could recover from a stall on May 10 when he lost control of the plane, according to a report of the incident released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. 'Watch this,' Mr Edwards was reported to have said shortly before the plane's right wing dropped rapidly, sending the aircraft into a spin. Scroll down for video . The crash scene in the Blue Mountains on May 10 after a pilot and salesman failed to regain control of the Cirrus SR22 plane while demonstrating a stall . After the planes third rotational spin, it became clear that the pilot would not be able to regain control from the maneuver. The passenger in the front seat of the aircraft claimed it was at this point that Mr Edwards clearly stated 'I'm sorry'. About 2,000 feet above the ground, the pilot released the aircraft's parachute. Narrowly avoiding some nearby power lines, the plane collided with the branches of a tree before crashing down onto a resident's fence. The plane landed in the front yard of Blue Mountains property belonging to Sheila Riordan who appeared more concerned that her nap had been interrupted in an interview with the Blue Mountains Gazette. The 66-year-old told the publication that she heard loud bangs but didn't think anything of it, saying that her first thought was 'there's no peace'. None of the three people aboard were injured after the plane landed in the front yard of Blue Mountains resident Sheila Riordan's property . 'When I first saw it I thought \"that's a surprise\". But I really am glad that no-one got hurt. It could have been awful, the bush could have gone up, people could have got hurt. It’s the only place they could have landed neatly,' Ms Riordan said. The passenger in the front seat claimed that once the plane had come to its resting position, he had to shake the pilot who he described as appearing 'dazed', urging him to 'hurry up and open the door and exit the aircraft'. He claims he was also forced to switch the ignition and master switches and fuel selector off, as the pilot had previously failed to do so. The report stated that Mr Edwards claimed he had performed the same manoeuvre earlier that day with no problems, however he admitted that 'he was probably overconfident as he had done the demonstration 30-50 times in the previous six months'.", "reference": "The pilot was demonstrating how the aircraft  could recover from a stall when he lost control of the plane .\nIt narrowly avoided power lines before crashing in a Blue Mountains yard .\nThe three people were uninjured due to the release of the plane's parachute ."}

He ran outside and chased the dogs away, but it was too late to spare his son from serious injury, but his heroic actions may have saved the boy’s life. The surgeon had to reattach Colton Brown’s left cheek and ear, the procedure took two hours, the family said. ‘Breaks my heart that instead of my baby having [an] awesome day, he is stuck in a hospital and is hurt badly, no child should go [through] this,’ the distraught mother wrote to Facebook. Hardegree chased the dogs away, and animal control officers have not seen them since. Officials are still hunting for both the dogs and their owner. Doctors told Colton Brown’s parents that not finding the dogs within another day or two will force them to require the toddler to get a rabies shot. It is not possible to determine if the dogs were infected with the deadly disease without first locating them. The young boy has been released from the hospital, but Lindsay Brown told WAGA she is upset over the ordeal. ‘You shouldn't have a home and worry that something is going to happen to your child in your own backyard.’", "reference": "Colton Brown's head was in the clenched jaws of two dogs when his father ran out to save his life .\nThe beasts had wandered into his yard while fighting over a dead animal .\nThe tot required plastic surgery to reattach his cheek and ear ."}

{"id": 15422, "article": "By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . The forensic dissecting of England’s World Cup hopes by Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan looked anything but harsh on Wednesday as Alastair Cook’s ‘retro’ side were comprehensively dismantled by the defending champions. India, such a rabble in the last three Tests, came alive once the red ball was swapped for two white ones and provided a lesson to England on how to play modern 50-over cricket in conditions that should have suited the hosts perfectly. It was Swann who said during Monday’s washed-out game at Bristol that England ‘haven’t got a cat in hell’s chance’ of winning their first World Cup next year and, on this evidence, he was being kind to them. VIDEO Scroll down for Joe Root defends England Captain Cook ahead of India ODI . Jubilant: India fielders MS Dhoni (right) and Suresh Raina celebrate after dismissing Jos Buttler . Mistake: England's Alex Hales skies a delivery from India's Ravindra Jadeja before being caught out . VIDEO Alastair Cook targets fight back after Cardiff defeat . But they were comments that angered his close friend and recent captain Cook, who Swann feels should no longer be one-day leader. ‘It wasn’t that helpful, especially from a so-called friend and after the summer I’ve had,’ said Cook after England’s thumping 133-run Duckworth-Lewis defeat at the Swalec Stadium. ‘Yes I am disappointed because he is a good friend of mine and has been a supporter. But it is what it is. I am going to be captain in this World Cup and we have a good chance but if we play like that we’re not going to win many games.’ Everything was in England’s favour when Cook won the toss and Chris Woakes took two wickets in an over to leave India on 19 for two in what was effectively the first one-day international of a four-match Royal London series. Yet, under grey Cardiff skies and with the ball nipping around, the back-up seam bowlers blew their big chance to maintain the pressure on India and silence the old players who believe England are stuck in the one-day dark ages. Knock: Debutant Hales and captain Alastair Cook (right) raised hopes in a solid opening stand of 54 . Slip and slide: Eoin Morgan survives a run out attempt before eventually being caught for 28 . Chris Jordan, in particular, had a nightmare, bowling 12 wides in 10 expensive, wicketless overs and later departing second ball as England capitulated to a miserable 161 in reply to India’s formidable 304 for six. Those Indian riches owed much to a 74-ball century from Suresh Raina, not good enough for Test cricket but a formidable proposition in the shorter game, but also to old-fashioned application that is meant to be England’s preserve. Firstly Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane rebuilt India’s innings as Jordan and Ben Stokes, preferred to Steven Finn and Harry Gurney, bowled woefully and then Raina ran wild in company with his rejuvenated captain MS Dhoni. Dhoni looked uninterested and tired as England ultimately thrashed India in the Test series but here he was bristling and imaginative, a perfect summation of the modern priorities of the most powerful nation in cricket. As, too, was the presence in Wales of a large number of Indian supporters, as many as 40 per cent of the 14,000 crowd, who were conspicuous by their absence during the five Tests, a worry for the health of the ultimate game. England, in contrast, have always paid lip service to limited-overs cricket but have perennially struggled to find a winning formula and look as far away as ever as they embark on their extensive six-month one-day World Cup build-up. Ton: India's Raina celebrates getting 100 runs against England as he inspired his side to victory . Head down: Alex Hales walks off back to the pavillion after being dismissed in Cardiff . One of their enduring problems is a lack of penetration in the middle overs and that was exposed here as Raina and Dhoni added 144 off just 16.5 overs to change the complexion of what looked likely to be a low-scoring game. There was one huge slice of luck for India when Raina should have been given out lbw sweeping James Tredwell on 17 but, after that carnage ensued, with only Woakes and Tredwell able to limit the damage on England. Much of the criticism from Swann and Vaughan centred on a perceived lack of power in the England line-up and certainly there was considerable expectations on the shoulders of Alex Hales on his 50-over debut. Yet Hales acquitted himself well and showed he has a solid technique as well as power in top scoring with 40 but becoming bogged down while everyone around him floundered on a pitch that had been spiced up by showers. Out: India's Virat Kohli (left) congratulates team-mate Ravindra Jadeja after the dismissal of Hales . I'll take that: Hales (left) hits the ball back to India's Mohammed Shami during the second ODI in Cardiff . Cook could at least point to an unlucky dismissal as the ball from Mohammad Shami that trapped him lbw was shown to have pitched fractionally outside leg-stump but there was little to excuse the bulk of his under-performing side. The England captain had added 54 with Hales but after he fell his ship quickly sank, all 10 England wickets falling for 107 in just 28.1 overs. A thrashing by any standards. ‘We weren’t at the races and I don’t know why,’ added Cook. ‘It’s frustrating but it’s one game and we will now dust ourselves off and try to play better next time. We’ve got a lot of improving to do.’ When England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Durham earlier this season they immediately came back with a convincing victory at Old Trafford.

A mother who was swigging vodka at the wheel of a car with her baby daughter sat next to her was three times over the drink-drive limit, a court has heard. Deborah Poulton was pulled over by police after being reported by another driver for dangerous driving. Poulton’s car was spotted weaving across a road before mounting the kerb, narrowly missing a cyclist. When police stopped the 38-year-old, they found her 13-month-old daughter strapped into a car seat of the Fiat Seicento, the court was told. Poulton, from Poole, Dorset, was arrested after a roadside breath test revealed she had 103 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, three times the legal limit. The baby was picked up by her father. Poulton pleaded guilty to drink driving at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court and now faces a minimum 12-month driving ban, up to six months in prison and a fine of up to £5,000. A separate charge of being drunk in charge of a child was dropped. Heather Jackson, prosecuting, said that earlier the same day staff at a nearby Co-op store had reported Poulton for drunken behaviour. She said: 'She went to visit a friend during the day, then left her daughter with her friend to drive to the Co-op to buy cigarette papers and wine. 'In her car was a Lucozade bottle containing vodka from which she was drinking. The police received a call about her demeanour from the store - she had slurred speech. 'She returned to her friend’s address in the car and consumed the bottle of Lucozade and vodka. 'Poulton then left with her daughter in the car, almost crashing several times.' Poulton pleaded guilty to drink driving at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court and faces a driving ban . Mark Proctor, mitigating, said Poulton’s drinking had 'spiralled out of control' and that she hid alcohol in her car so her boyfriend did not know she had it. He said: 'She turned to alcohol as a means to deal with other issues in her life. 'She hadn’t felt under the influence of alcohol when she got into the car. 'She was very forthcoming in her interview with the police and very apologetic for her actions.'

If Phil Collins has taught us anything, it is that You Can't Hurry Love - especially when its a love of collecting historical artifacts from a Wild West battle almost 180 years ago. After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum. The 63-year-old Genesis singer-drummer joked he'd spent 'all the money that I made from music' on 200-plus pieces related to the battle where 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to 200 Texans in 1836. The Alamo: After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum . Homecoming: Collins made the announcement under the shadow of the Alamo itself in Texas . 'Some people would buy Ferraris, some . people would buy houses, I bought old bits of metal and old bits of . paper,' Collins said. 'It's at my home, in my basement in Switzerland. I . look at it every day, but no one else was enjoying it.' On Thursday, Collins stood outside the Alamo as he announced plans to donate his vast collection to the Texas museum. Collins . has been an Alamo aficionado since growing up in London and watching . actor Fess Parker portray Davy Crockett in 1955 Disney miniseries, 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier'. The series chronicled the frontier legend of Crockett, who eventually died as one of the defenders of the Alamo. The last surviving roll from the Alamo is included in the artifacts being donated to the Texas museum . A flattened cannonball, pictured next to a quarter for scale, is part of the collection . Defense: An assortment of weapons, from axes and knives to guns, below, are also part of the collection . 'I've . had a love affair with this place since I was about 5 years old,' said . Collins, who sweated in a button-down shirt and spectacles before a . cheering crowd of dignitaries and tourists who gathered in front of the . Alamo for the occasion. 'It was something that I used to go and play in . the garden with my soldiers,' he said. Collins . said his favorite artifact was also his first, purchased for him in the . 1990s by his then-wife: a receipt for the sale of the saddle of John W. Smith, an Alamo messenger who rode through Mexican lines and pleaded . for reinforcements before the battle. The . collection also includes a rifle owned by Crockett, his leather shot . pouch and a pair of powder horns Crockett is believed to have given to a . Mexican officer before his death — as well as muskets and musket balls . that belonged to Mexican soldiers. Phil Collins says he has been obsessed with Davy Crockett since he was a child . Last stand: The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (pictured: a painting of the battle which hangs at the museum) Lifelong passion: Collins, 63, said he became fascinated with the Alamo story when he was growing up in the 1950s watching the television series 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier' starring Fess Parker (right) as the eponymous hero (pictured with co-star Buddy Ebsen) Collins said he first visited the famed battle site while on tour with his band in 1973. Each band member was allowed to pick one place in the U.S. trip - and he chose the Alamo. 'I was just spellbound when I first saw . it in person,' he recalled. 'Having lived all my life, to see it in . books and movies and the pictures in magazines, it was really quite . extraordinary.' His decision to donate the items to the Alamo was because he wanted the collection - which he is still adding to - to be kept together, Texas Monthly reported. 'It doesn’t end my involvement with Texas history. It’s my intention to keep accumulating, keep collecting, and once I’ve lived with whatever I buy for a month, I’ll be shipping it here. 'I’m kind of a bit of a magnet now for things relating to the Texas revolution,' he said. Collins has agreed to ship the collection to Texas, but on the proviso that the museum updates the site and constructs a new building to house the collection. Phil Collins has written a book, The Alamo and Beyond, about his collection of artifacts . Helmets and explosive devices, which Collins has collected over the years, have been donated to a museum . Letters and other paperwork related to the Alamo are included in the donation .

It was after him that the Bowie knife was named. For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events. Celebrated . in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds . helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty. The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. The leaders of the group included Davy Crockett (pictured), already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting. News of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels, who defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto amid cries of 'Remember the Alamo!' The historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed Republic of Texas. The legend was firmly established by the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill.

A Chicago father-of-two, who recently came out as homosexual, is accused of murdering his wife in an elaborate fake hijacking in order to get an insurance payout. Darron Brewer, 26, allegedly convinced his younger brother, Dujuan Powe, to hijack his family's car and force 22-year-old Kenyatae Collier-Brewer into the trunk where she was shot dead as the couple's children were in the back seat. The brothers, who are now on trial, then planned to collect on a spousal life insurance policy provided through Brewer's employer, the U.S. National Guard, that would no longer be valid if the gay man ended his marriage, prosecutors said. Accused: Darron Brewer, pictured, is on trial for the murder of his wife Kenyatae Collier-Brewer . Those benefits 'were about to end because their marriage was going to end,' Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Jeff Allen told jurors in opening statements on Monday. 'Greed is the only word to describe why Kenyatae had to die.' He added that Brewer's boyfriend will testify during the trial. According to DNAInfo, police found Collier-Brewer's dead body in the trunk of the car after the October 25, 2009 slaying. Brewer called 911 to report the hijacking and gave the location of the vehicle. The gun used to take her life was found hidden under a pile of mattresses at Powe's girlfriend's home, implicating the brothers, who each claim their innocence and blame the other. Victim: Kenyatae Collier-Brewer, 22, was found dead in the family's car after the October 25, 2009 slaying . The pair had in fact planned to kill the young mother earlier in October, according to Allen, but failed. Allen said Powe, who goes by the name 'Scooter,' was supposed to surprise Collier-Brewer in her home and 'choke her to death.' 'He saw her coming out of the bathroom, he couldn't do it,' Allen said, adding that instead of killing her at that time, he had consensual sex with her. The alleged murder plot finally played out a couple of weeks later, when Collier-Brewer finished work and collected Brewer and their two children on the South Side of the city to take them home. On trial: Dujuan Powe, pictured, is also on trial in the murder . Her husband took the wheel while she . dozed in the front seat on their way to their West Side home but he took . a detour, going more than a mile out of his way to get gas at a . station. That's where, Powe ambushed the family, wearing a mask from the movie 'Scream,' and, wielding a gun, forced Collier-Brewer to crawl into the trunk. Allen told the jury the entire fake carjacking was caught by a surveillance camera, footage from which is likely to be shown in court as the trial continues. 'You'll see (Brewer) rearrange items in the trunk that will become her coffin,' Allen said. 'You'll see the fake carjacking go down.' The woman's body was discovered in the trunk about 24 hours later after her husband reported her missing. '(Brewer) planned it, and then did it,' Allen said, asking jurors to find both men guilty of Collier-Brewer's murder. But attorneys for both Brewer and Powe blame the other in the slaying. 'Scooter had his own plan. Scooter comes up with a mask and and gun ... and he pulls a carjacking,' defense attorney Rebecca Washtenaw said, according to DNAInfo. 'Darron puts his head in the sand.' Powe's public defender Brian Walsh told jurors that the younger brother 'was not in on the plan, did not take part in the plan.' Powe's brother 'wanted out of his relationship so bad he wanted to kill her,' Walsh told jurors.", "reference": "Darron Brewer, 26, and his brother, Dujuan Powe, are on trial for the murder of 22-year-old Kenyatae Collier-Brewer .\nBrewer, who recently came out, convinced Powe to hijack his family's car wearing a mask from the movie 'Scream' and force Collier-Brewer into the trunk where she was shot dead, prosecutors said .\nThe brothers then allegedly planned to cash in Brewer's life insurance policy ."}
{"id": 15427, "article": "Thai anti-government demonstrators massed Wednesday outside the Prime Minister's makeshift office, a day after clashes with police in the streets of Bangkok killed five people. The protesters have been rallying in the city for months, demanding that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra step down. Their long-running campaign has deepened political divisions in Thailand, undermined the functioning of the national government and stirred outbreaks of deadly violence. The demonstrators want to rid the country of the influence of Yingluck and her older brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who they say controls the government from self-imposed exile. They are calling for the creation of an unelected \"people's council\" to oversee electoral and political changes. 10 questions: What's behind the protests in Thailand? Deadly clashes . With Thailand still scarred by a severe bout of civil unrest in 2010 -- in which a crackdown on pro-Thaksin protesters by security forces left scores of people dead -- police had until recently largely refrained from using force on the current demonstrations. But last week, police began attempts to clear sites occupied by protesters for months. Government officials said the protesters' actions were blocking public access to government services. The police measures encountered strong resistance from protesters in central Bangkok on Tuesday, and clashes between the two sides erupted into gun fire. Five people, including a police officer, died in the violence, and more than 70 were wounded. Police have suspended efforts to seize the protest sites for the time being, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, the national security chief. Protesters gather . The anti-government protesters, meanwhile, are trying to keep up the pressure on Yingluck by gathering Wednesday outside Defense Secretariat offices in the suburbs of Bangkok where the Prime Minister has set up a temporary office. She has had to relocate there after the demonstrators blocked access to Government House, the office of the Prime Minister and appointed cabinet ministers in central Bangkok. Thousands of demonstrators assembled near the Defense Secretariat compound, arriving by foot, on bikes and in pick-up trucks. Some of them waved flags and others blew whistles, a trademark of their movement. About 1,000 police officers in riot gear were positioned outside the compound. It wasn't immediately unclear whether Yingluck was inside the offices Wednesday. She gave a televised speech from there on Tuesday. Political uncertainty . The Prime Minister is also facing difficulties over her government's controversial rice subsidy program. Thailand's anti-corruption commission said Tuesday it was bringing charges against Yingluck over allegations she failed to act on warnings of corruption in the program, which paid farmers well above the market rate for their rice but has run into financial problems. Yingluck said Tuesday that the program had been successful and that there was \"no conspiracy to corrupt.\" The current protests in Bangkok were sparked in November by Yingluck's government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother's return to the political fray in earnest. Yingluck called elections in December in the hope that they wcould help ease tensions. But the main opposition party boycotted the vote earlier this month, and protesters caused widespread disruption, making the outcome of the election inconclusive. That has left Yingluck's caretaker administration unable to operate fully.", "reference": "Demonstrators assemble outside the Prime Minister's temporary office .\nThousands of them arrive on foot, on bikes and in pick-up trucks .\nClashes between demonstrators and police left five people dead on Tuesday .\nThe protesters have been campaigning against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ."}
{"id": 15428, "article": "Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar on Monday, praising the courage of fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi while also providing a symbolic nod to initial reforms in a nation once notorious for political repression. Later, Obama traveled to Cambodia for a summit of regional leaders and held what an aide called a \"tense\"meeting with the host country's prime minister that emphasized the need for improving human rights there. The president's trip, his first overseas since winning re-election this month, foreshadowed the focus his administration will place on Asia in a second term as part of a strategy to blunt Chinese influence in the region. Cambodia is an ally of China. Monday's highlight was the several hours Obama spent in Myanmar, the formerly secretive country also known as Burma. The president met with Suu Kyi at the lakeside villa where she spent years under house arrest for her pro-democracy activism. Obama called the meeting a new chapter between the two countries. \"Here, through so many difficult years, is where she has displayed such unbreakable courage and determination,\" Obama told reporters, standing next to Suu Kyi. \"It is here where she showed that human freedom and human dignity cannot be denied.\" Myanmar was politically and economically isolated from the rest of the world for decades until it ended military rule last year. In a diplomatic show of support, Obama referred to the country by the government's preferred name -- Myanmar -- rather than the colonial name of Burma used by Suu Kyi and democracy activists. Suu Kyi warned that Myanmar's reform process would be difficult. \"The most difficult time in any transition is when we think success is in sight, then we have to be very careful that we are not lured by a mirage of success, and that we are working toward its genuine success for our people and friendship between our two countries,\" she said. Opinion: Myanmar faces unfolding crisis . Before meeting Suu Kyi, Obama spent an hour with Myanmar President Thein Sein, whose reform drive has seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and steps to open the country's economy. The democratic and economic reforms started by the president could lead to \"incredible development opportunities,\" Obama said. Thein Sein, who wore a long purple sarong and white shirt, told Obama he was committed to strengthening bilateral relations. The name Myanmar was introduced by the former military regime 23 years ago and is preferred by the country's current leaders. Until Monday, the Obama administration had largely stuck to the British colonial name of Burma. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that Obama exercised  \"diplomatic courtesy\" in referencing Myanmar instead of Burma when meeting with Thein Sein. The official U.S. position continued to be that the country's name is Burma, Rhodes said. As well as meeting Thein Sein and Suu Kyi, Obama delivered a speech at the University of Yangon in which he urged the country to continue its \"remarkable journey.\" \"The flickers of progress that we have seen must not be extinguished,\" Obama said. \"Reforms launched from the top of society must meet the aspirations of citizens who form its foundation.\" After leaving Myanmar, Obama traveled to Cambodia for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that began with a first round of talks Monday followed by an evening dinner. The president also discussed human rights issues in the host country with Prime Minister Hun Sen, highlighting the case of a Cambodian radio broadcaster sentenced to prison for something he said on air about land seizures, according to Rhodes. He described the meeting as \"tense,\" in keeping with past U.S. efforts to raise human rights issues with Cambodia. Hun Sen offered no promises, but expressed a desire for closer economic ties with the United States, Rhodes said. In essence, Rhodes said, Obama was delivering a similar message in both Cambodia and Myanmar. At the dinner Monday night, Obama and the other regional leaders wore shirts of batik, the colorful cloth that express Southeast Asia's tropical culture. The president sat between Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Hun Sen. The visit to Myanmar created \"Obama fever\" in Yangon, with crowds waving U.S. flags lining the street from the airport to greet the U.S. president. His meeting with Thein Sein took place in the nation's largest city, rather than the isolated capital. Obama's image also featured on T-shirts and mugs for sale in city stores. Before his trip, Obama insisted the visit was \"not an endorsement of the Burmese government.\" \"This is an acknowledgment that there is a process under way inside that country that even a year and a half, two years ago, nobody foresaw,\" Obama told reporters in Thailand on Sunday, the first stop on his Asia trip. He added that the country was moving \"in a better direction.\" Western governments have responded to Myanmar's progressive efforts by easing sanctions that targeted the military regime. On Friday, the U.S. eased restrictions on imports of most goods from Burma. But the country has also witnessed bouts of turmoil in recent months. Violence between Rohingya Muslims and local Buddhists broke out in the western state of Rakhine. What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? During the latest eruption of tensions, the United Nations said at least 89 people were killed over two weeks of violence and 110,000 were displaced. Obama urged Myanmar to use its \"diversity as a strength, not a weakness.\" \"I believe deeply that this country can transcend its differences, and that every human being within these borders is a part of your nation's story.\" He met briefly with representatives of civil society organizations, including an advocate for Burma's Rohingya population. However, some aid organizations questioned whether now is the right time for Obama to add legitimacy to Thein Sein's government. Burmese exile leaders and human rights advocates have expressed concerns that the visit is too soon, and may not yield the additional reforms that a presidential visit can deliver if it happens at the right time.", "reference": "President Obama has a \"tense\" meeting with Cambodia's leader .\nThe president is in Cambodia for a summit of Southeast Asian nations .\nObama meets with pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar's president .\nObama is the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar, also known as Burma ."}

A U.N. General Assembly committee Tuesday voted in favor of the draft resolution condemning the country's human rights record and calling for \"targeted sanctions.\" Before the vote, Choe Myong Nam, North Korea's representative at the U.N., issued a familiar warning, saying that seeking to punish the country on human rights \"is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests.\" \"The reality is the need for us to maintain powerful state capability in order to defend our people's human rights,\" he said. \"The outrageous and unreasonable human rights campaign staged by the United States and it followers in their attempts to eliminate the state and social system of the (North Korea) is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests.\" The 111-19 vote, with 55 abstentions, is merely a recommendation. The General Assembly does not have the power to refer the regime or its leader, Kim Jong Un, to the ICC. The non-binding measure will come up for a vote by the General Assembly in December. The authority to refer a country to the ICC lies only with the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body charged with maintaining global security. The five permanent members at the core of the Security Council, including China and Russia, wield veto powers. Opponents of the resolution -- including China, Russia and Cuba -- said the measure was politically manipulated and would set a precedent for other nations to be targeted in the future. The North Korean representative told the U.N. gathering Tuesday that the resolution \"provoked confrontation\" and \"failed to reflect the reality on the ground.\" China is likely to use its veto against the resolution.  Chinese officials have repeatedly said efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC \"won't help improve a country's human rights condition.\" North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang. North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence and mass starvation to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens. North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country, and has accused the United States and its allies of seeking to discredit and overthrow the North Korean leadership. North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' In February, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action, including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution. Last month, U.S. military officials said they believe the North Koreans have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on an intermediate or long-range missile. If true, it represents a significant increase in North Korea's quest for a long-range nuclear weapon. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said he believes the North Koreans have the \"capability\" to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, but stressed they have not tested any such device. In April, North Korea announced that it wouldn't rule out \"a new form of a nuclear test\" to strengthen its nuclear deterrent capabilities. Experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb. The regime in Pyongyang is known to have conducted three previous tests, all of them believed to be based on plutonium.

{"id": 15435, "article": "James Franco won't be following Dennis Rodman into North Korea anytime soon. Franco's latest movie -- a comedy about two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- has earned the distinction of a frothing rant from the regime in Pyongyang. \"The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership,\" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman told the country's state-run news agency Wednesday. The film, titled \"The Interview,\" stars Franco and Seth Rogen as two lightweight talk show hosts recruited by the CIA to take out Kim. It's not due in theaters until October, but the trailer is already drawing worldwide attention, including in the corridors of power in Pyongyang. 'Team America' The distribution of the movie is \"the most undisguised terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their mental mainstay and bring down its social system,\" the North Korean spokesman raged, using an abbreviation of the authoritarian country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Comedians taking shots at North Korea's dictatorial leadership is hardly new -- it goes back at least a generation. A decade ago, \"Team America: World Police\" used puppets to lampoon Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, memorably featuring him singing about his loneliness at the top of the despotic state. Kim Jong Il also popped up as a waiter in NBC's \"Thirty Rock\" -- albeit one who claimed to be \"the greatest waiter of all time.\" Brutal regime . The situation in North Korea is no joke. A recent United Nations commission detailed a horrifying list of crimes it says the regime has committed against its own people, including the large-scale use of prison camps and torture. The cold-blooded brutality of the system was displayed late last year when Kim Jong Un's uncle was purged and executed. Meanwhile, the isolated state continues to develop its nuclear weapons program, which it has used to threaten neighboring countries and the United States. Will Kim watch? But like his father, Kim Jong Un has also brought about bizarre moments in his two and a half years in power, such as his basketball-based friendship with Rodman. Such peculiar behavior, along with the secrecy in which the regime cloaks itself, is hard for comedians to resist. The Telegraph last week cited Kim Myong-chol, the executive director of the Centre for North Korea-U.S. Peace and a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, as suggesting that Kim would probably watch the new movie. That prompted glee from Rogen, who also co-directed and wrote the film. \"Apparently Kim Jong Un plans on watching #TheInterview. I hope he likes it!!\" he tweeted. 'Towering hatred' But the North Korean government showed little sign of favor toward the film on Wednesday, accusing the United States of \"bribing a rogue movie maker\" to produce it. And it warned that Franco and Rogen's comedy, which it said had touched off \"the towering hatred and wrath of the service personnel and people of the DPRK,\" would have consequences. \"Those who defamed our supreme leadership and committed the hostile acts against the DPRK can never escape the stern punishment to be meted out according to a law wherever they might be in the world,\" the foreign ministry spokesman said. \"If the U.S. administration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film, it will invite a strong and merciless countermeasure.\"", "reference": "A new comedy starring James Franco is about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un .\nNorth Korea says the movie hurts \"the dignity of the supreme leadership\"\nDistributing the film is \"the most undisguised terrorism and a war action,\" an official says .\nComedians have taken shots at the regime in the past, notably in \"Team America\""}

One of America’s priciest divorce cases is coming to an end now baseball power couple Frank and Jamie McCourt are said to have come to a deal. Former LA Dodgers CEO Jamie will reportedly abandon claims for a share of the team from the owner - her husband Frank - and get $130million. It means Jamie will no longer prevent Frank’s plan to remain owner by selling the troubled baseball team’s television rights in a bankruptcy court. Power couple: Frank and Jamie McCourt were married for nearly 30 years, before their separation sparked one of the costliest divorce fights in California history . Big league legal brawl: Jamie McCourt had sought half of the Dodgers franchise after a judge deemed her post-nuptial agreement with Frank McCourt invalid . A divorce filing valued the marriage at $1.2billion, including six homes and the $800million LA Dodgers. The couple lived a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet and $10,000 a month for Jamie's hair stylist. They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing and Frank once shelled out $80,000 on a Caribbean vacation. A settlement would end the two-year case . of what is believed to be California’s costliest divorce ever, . reported the Los Angeles Times. It will also clear the way for Frank . to take on Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig in court as he . tries to keep hold of the Dodgers. The couple spent more than $20million . over the divorce in July - and the battle over who owned the Dodgers . could have added another $14million. The couple announced in October 2009 that they would be ending their 30-year marriage - and Frank fired Jamie as CEO. Comfortable living: This a Los Angeles property of Frank McCourt.

The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in June and lawyers for Jamie alleged that Frank was running the team into the ground. But Frank’s counsel claimed it was Jamie who was refusing to accept any settlements and was allowing the case to drag on. The Dodgers blamed a cash-flow crisis . on the MLB's refusal to pass the television deal that Frank was . counting on to keep the team afloat. A judge ruled last December that a post-nuptial marital agreement that gave Frank sole ownership of the Dodgers was invalid. That allowed Jamie to seek half the team under California's community property law. The McCourts had reached a settlement that was contingent on MLB's approval of the TV deal with Fox, worth up to $3billion.

He's spent his career playing despicable characters - a rapist in Doctors, a homophobe in Hollyoaks, an abusive boyfriend in Casualty, and now Ross Barton, Emmerdale's womanising crook. But Michael Parr couldn't be happier. 'I think it's better to play baddies,' says the 27-year-old St Helens-born actor. 'They're always in the thick of the action and you get all these wicked things to say and do.' As Emmerdale's resident bad boy Ross, he's had his fair share. Ross arrived in the village a year ago, attacking Laurel Thomas and stealing her car. Since then he's been shot in a drug-gang dispute, bungled a robbery with corrupt cop Donna Windsor, and is now falling for her. Michael Parr insists that, in real life, he doesn't live up to his bad boy character . 'Ross is great to play – he's someone you love to hate,' says Michael. 'And even though he does horrible things, now and then he has a lighter side. 'The lines they give me are absolute gold dust. I don't know what it is about me that gets me chosen for these roles. I think I have a menacing stare that puts the wind up people – that's all I can put it down to.' New York or Dubai? I go to New York all the time because my mum's family come from there.Curry or pizza? Pizza. I had one last night, and the night before, and the night before that - seriously! Beer or spirits? G&T in the summer, but lager the rest of the time. Pub or club? At 27 I already feel I'm older than everyone else in clubs, so I'm becoming a pub person.Oasis or Nirvana? My first album was Nevermind by Nirvana. I like walking with aggressive music, like rock and hip-hop, in my headphones.Designer clothes or high street? I prefer plain clothes to labels.Football or boxing? I did Thai boxing for years and love watching pretty much any kind of martial art. In real life, Michael couldn't be more different from his on-screen character. After graduating from drama school aged 21 and while auditioning for acting roles, he worked as a teaching assistant in special needs schools in London. 'Some days it could be the hardest job I've ever done, but it was also incredibly rewarding,' he recalls. 'When you see the children are learning, and you're growing very fond of them, no other job can compare. I think I was a positive role model,' Michael says proudly. 'I'm still in contact with some of them and write job references for them. 'But they made more of an impression on me! The main thing I took from it is to never feel sorry for myself again. Lots of them had problems at home, so coming to school was a major issue, but they were still excited to be there. It gave me another outlook on life.' But Michael's main goal was always acting and after landing minor roles in other TV soaps and dramas he beat off dozens of rivals for the part of Ross. It came just in time for his biggest fan to see him perform in a major soap. 'My grandma sadly passed away at Christmas, but it meant she got to see me on screen and she had the ultimate bragging rights at church,' he smiles. Michael's acting success is even more remarkable given that he's dyslexic. 'I've always got by,' he says. 'Reading scripts is fine. But if you asked me to do a presenting job, reading an autocue, I just wouldn't have a hope.' He says his hectic schedule leaves little time for romance. 'I've had girlfriends, but nothing too serious as at the moment I'm so busy at work!

Kylie Simonds, from Naugatuck, Connecticut, was just eight when she was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare bone and soft tissue cancer, and she says the heavy IV pole she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and scarier. So the savvy tween came up with a solution: an IV backpack specially designed to accommodate a pump for chemotherapy or transfusions. Scroll down for video . Genius invention: Cancer survivor Kylie Simonds, 11, from Naugatuck, Connecticut, has invented an IV backpack that makes it easier and less scary for kids to be hooked up to the IV during chemo . The perfect solution: She says the heavy IV poles she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and more daunting . The backpack began as a school project that required her to solve an everyday problem; for Kylie, the standard issue IV pole was her own personal everyday issue to overcome. 'It was really scary for me at a young age, which was eight,' she told MSNBC. 'I had to use the big IV poles which were actually really heavy to push around and they had lots of wires and tubes I would trip over or get tangled in.' To combat these setbacks, Kylie designed a backpack which is fitted with the IV pole on the top corner of the bag. A wire protector around the IV sack ensures that it won't pop if you lean on it, and the medical machine goes inside the bag. Instead of the clinical white and metal pole patients normally use, Kylie's backpack is pink and Hello Kitty-themed, making it even less threatening to children with cancer. And since it straps onto your back, it allows young patients to play and do activities to distract themselves while undergoing chemo. Kid-friendly: Kylie's backpack is fitted with the IV pole on the top corner of the bag. A wire protector around the IV sack ensures that it won't pop if you lean on it, and the medical machine goes inside the bag . After 46 weeks of chemotherapy and several surgeries, Kylie was confirmed cancer-free two years ago, and now she's focusing on helping others. Now, thanks to all the attention she has received for her invention, Kylie hopes to actually get her prototype made so she can provide it to children and hospitals everywhere. She is asking for supporters to donate money via her Go Fund Me page to make her invention a reality. So far, she has raised more than $46,000, with an ultimate goal of $50,000 to fund the manufacturing of a usable IV backpack.

{"id": 15442, "article": "Washington (CNN) -- A team of engineers will delay until Wednesday their plans to rappel down the sides of the Washington Monument, a photographer for the contractor said Tuesday, citing bad weather as the cause. \"They plan to start first thing in the morning,\" photographer Ryan Pratzel told CNN as rain and possible thunderstorms approached. The engineers will be looking for damage caused by the August earthquake. \"The engineering team and the rappelling team, a combination of people from Denali National Park in Alaska as well as from an engineering firm, will come out of the windows at the 500-foot level,\" said Bill Line, spokesman for the National Park Service. \"What they will do is do a very close visual inspection to check to see if there are any smaller cracks that were sustained during the earthquake,\" Line said. Engineers will work \"to determine whether those cracks could, in the next couple of years, grow.\" Officials need to \"get up close\" and search for possible damage, Line said. The concerns stem from the August 23 earthquake, which shook much of the East Coast. The Park Service said Monday that the interior assessment found the monument is structurally sound. \"The heaviest damage appears to be concentrated at the very top of the monument, in what is called the pyramidion, where large cracks of up to 1-1/4 inch wide developed through stone and mortar joints,\" said Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Daylight is visible through some of the cracks, and rain water has gotten into the monument, which could cause further damage. The difficult-access rappelling team -- which includes members of the firm of Wiss, Janney and Elstner -- will scale the outside of the structure to get a closer look. They will install climbing ropes and safety lines on all four sides, then clip onto those lines, Vogel said. Weather permitting, they will climb up the pyramidion and then descend the length of the monument looking for exterior damage. On Monday, the Park Service put on its web page video of the interior of the monument that was shot during the earthquake. It shows park rangers and tourists rushing down the stairs as debris falls onto the observation deck. The video also shows a ranger, Niki Williams, helping visitors and remaining calm. \"She had the presence of mind, she had the composure, to make certain that she got people down to the 490-foot level and started walking down the stairs,\" said Line. \"She showed a lot of courage, in fact, by coming back up to the 500-foot level to collect the last remaining visitors and to ensure their safety and put their safety ahead of her own in order to get everybody out safely. So we're extremely proud of the work she has done.\" In a few weeks, after the exterior assessment is completed, the Park Service expects to come up with a timeline to reopen the monument to the public.

{"id": 15443, "article": "Beijing (CNN) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met Chinese leaders on Wednesday with discussions expected to focus on cooperation between the world's top two economies to bolster global growth as well as possible sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Geithner held talks Wednesday with Vice President Xi Jinping â€” tipped to become China's next president later this yearâ€” and Vice Premier Li Keqiang. He was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Wen Jiabao later Wednesday. Geithner met with his counterpart, Vice Premier Wang Qishan, on Tuesday night and pledged cooperation on global economic issues. China and the United States \"have a lot of issues to talk about in the areas of economy, finance, trade and investment,\" Wang said at a news briefing on Tuesday. While China has called on the United States to loosen export regulations, Washington has said that Chinese currency controls keep the yuan undervalued and give Chinese exporters an unfair advantage at a time when the global economy is suffering. In Geithner's meeting with Vice Presiden Xi on Wednesday morning, he emphasized the expansion of trade and investment with China. \"We are looking forward to exploring opportunities to expand our exports to China and to strengthen and deepen our cooperation with China on a broad range of economic and strategic issues we face around the world,\" said Geithner. \"On economic growth, financial stability around the world, on nonproliferation, we have what we view as a very strong cooperative relationship with your government and we are looking forward to building on that.\" Tensions between Tehran and Western powers over possible sanctions on Iranian oil were also expected to be on the agenda in Beijing. Iran threatened in late December to block the Strait of Hormuz if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports. France, Britain and Germany have all proposed such sanctions to punish Iran for lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. The strait is a critical shipping lane, through which 17 million barrels of oil passed per day in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. China relies on imports for half of the oil it consumes, buying nearly one-third of Iran's oil exports. Beijing has said that its imports have nothing to do with Tehran's nuclear program and rejects new U.S sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct business with the Central Bank of Iran. China, the world's biggest energy consumer, has supported U.N. sanctions on Iran's nuclear program, but says the decisions should be multilateral. Wen is scheduled to visit the oil-rich regions of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar this coming weekend, China's foreign ministry said Tuesday. Despite the high-level meetings, experts say China is unlikely to budge on the most sensitive issues anytime soon, especially with Washington's recent military strategy report that focuses on Beijing's economic power as a potential threat to U.S. security. \"China wants to cooperate with the U.S., but one visit by Geithner is not going to make a huge difference,\" said Zhao Kejin, a professor at Tsinghua University's Institute of International Studies. \"Currency, trade and Iran are huge issues that require more in-depth dialogue before we see results.\" After his meetings in China, Geithner will travel to Japan and hold talks with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and Finance Minister Jun Azumi on Thursday.", "reference": "NEW: Geithner emphasizes expanding trade and investment .\nDiscussions are expected to cover tensions over possible sanctions on Iranian oil exports .\nChina says its large imports of Iranian oil have nothing to do with Tehran's nuclear program .\nOfficials also talk about improving economic ties between China and the United States ."}

Now, two months later, the puppy has been nursed back to health on a diet of quality meat thanks her new owner butcher Suzanne Marsden. Mrs Marsden, who works at Fraser’s Butchers in Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'It was heartbreaking to think Elsa had just been left on her own in a fridge where she couldn’t get out. 'She was so tiny and so scared but she’s now a different dog, and she’s certainly not short of love. Hungry pup: Elsa has now been re-homed by the Marsden family - who are butchers.

{"id": 15446, "article": "This astonishing new photograph shows legendary American gunman Billy the Kid, a historian has claimed. The man on the right of this picture - taken around 1879 -  is believed to be the Wild West gunslinger. The picture is now generating huge excitement because, if authenticated, it would be only the second known image of the notorious outlaw. The other fetched more than $2million at . auction. Rare: This astonishing new photograph shows legendary American gunman Billy the Kid, a historian has claimed. The famous outlaw is pictured, right, with his friend Dan Dedrick left . The image, as reported by the Las Cruces Sun News, was released by New Mexico historian Frank Parrish. He claims to have extensively researched the picture to back up his claim that it is Billy the Kid. A large part of this involved identifying the man on the left, who he claims is Dan Dedrick -  a close friend of the outlaw. Speaking to the Albuquerque Journal, . Mr Parrish said: 'Identification of Dedrick is the \"clincher\" in this . image, elevating a near-certain image to a clearly and obvious picture . of the Kid. Pricey: This picture of Billy the Kid was sold for $2million at auction to billionaire William Koch . 'It’s finally a good image of the Kid . that reveals a young man as people who remembered him described him – . not as the famous bucktoothed Billy we know so well.' It is thought the picture was taken when the gunslinger was 20 - two years before he was killed. Mr Parrish admitted that some people will be skeptical of the picture. But he is absolutely certain that it shows Billy the Kid. 'It’s Billy,' he said. The only only surviving authentic photograph of the outlaw was expected to make $400,000 at an auction in 2011. But billionaire William Koch ended up paying more than $2million for it. The photograph - a tintype owned . by Dedrick's family for years - shows Billy the Kid packing a Colt . revolver and trademark 1873 Winchester carbine rifle. After . its purchase, the 71-year-old told the Denver Post: 'I love the Old . West. I plan on enjoying it and discreetly sharing it. 'I think I'll . display it in a few small museums.' The . photo was taken outside a saloon in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, when Billy . the Kid, born William Henry McCarty and later known as outlaw William . Bonney, was barely out of his teens. Experts estimate it was taken around 1879. But 132 years later, it endures as the most recognisable photo of the American West. It was only expected to fetch between . $300,000 and $400,000, but the price climbed dramatically in just two . minutes after Mr Koch began bidding. The . Kid gave the photograph to his friend, Dan Dedrick, and it's been kept . in the family for the last century, going on public display only once at . Lincoln County Museum in New Mexico in 1986 to 1998. It . was famously featured in a book by Pat Garrett, the sheriff who gunned . Billy down on July 14, 1881 - 130 years ago next month. Billy the Kid was a notorious 19th-century American gunman who was celebrated for his skill with guns. According to popular legend he killed 21 men, however,  it is generally believed that this figure is more likely to be between four and nine. He is thought to have been 17 when he killed his first man in 1877 - although some historians say he could have been as young as 15. Notorious: This image from the 1973 film 'Pat Garatt and Billy the Kid' starred Kris Kristofferson as the outlaw and Richard Jaeckel as a sheriff . He was friendly and personable and a smart dresser, often wearing a Mexican sombrero. These qualities contributed to his image as both a notorious outlaw and a folk hero. He was catapulted into legend in 1881 when New Mexico's governor, Lew Wallace, placed a price on his head. This prompted newspapers to carry stories about his exploits. It has been claimed that Billy the Kid was shot dead by Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881 despite being promised clemency for testifying in a murder case. He was killed a few months after escaping from jail.", "reference": "New Mexico historian Frank Parrish is certain picture shows gunman .\nIt is thought the picture was taken when Billy the Kid was 20 .\nThe only surviving authentic photograph of the outlaw sold for $2million ."}
{"id": 15447, "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Number of terminally ill people choosing to die Assisted suicides deaths have soared by 43 per cent in a U.S. state in the last year alone, latest figures revealed yesterday. The number of people who died in Washington state after they ingested lethal drugs climbed dramatically from 116 in 2012 to 159 last year. The 2013 figure is also three times the number who committed assisted suicide in 2009, the first year of the operation of the Death With Dignity Act. Assisted suicide was legalised in Washington state in 2008 and the Act came into force at the beginning of March the following year (pictured is Mount St Helens in Washington state) Ninety-seven per cent of the people who died last year were classed as ‘white non-Hispanic’, about half were married and three quarters of them had at least a college education. More than 90 per cent of those who died had either cancer or a degenerative disease. A total of 61 per cent said they wanted to die because they feared becoming a ‘burden on family, friends or caregivers’. Others said they no longer wanted to live because they were afraid of ‘losing autonomy’ or ‘being less able to engage in activities making life enjoyable’. Just 36 per cent voiced concerns about the ability of doctors to control their pain. Assisted suicide was legalised in Washington in 2008 and the Act came into force at the beginning of March the following year. It applied to people judged to have about six months or less to live and whose decision to end their lives had the support of two doctors. In the first 10 months of 2009, a total of 64 people took their own lives, and in the following years the numbers increased each time, rising from 85 in 2010 to 101 in 2011. Former Labour Minister Lord Falconer (above) has introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into Parliament to legalise assisted suicide . Elspeth Chowdharay-Best, the honorary secretary of Alert, the UK anti-euthanasia group, described the latest surge was ‘absolutely horrifying’. ‘People are wilfully ignoring the evidence of what happens when assisted suicide is legalised,’ she said. ‘Time and again we incremental increases in the numbers of people dying and in some places we see the categories of people who qualify for death widening repeatedly.’ The Washington State Department of Health Death With Dignity Act report comes just weeks after figures from Belgium revealed that doctors there are killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia. The statistics from Brussels also show a huge 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia cases in the last year alone in a country which in February became the first in the world to extend euthanasia to children. In Britain, the former Labour Minister Lord Falconer has introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into Parliament to legalise assisted suicide. It will have its Second Reading in the House of Lords on July 18 when peers will have the opportunity to vote on the proposed legislation for the first time.", "reference": "61% said they wanted to die because they feared becoming a ‘burden'\nAssisted suicide legalised in Washington in 2008 and Act came into force March 2009 .\n36% voiced concerns about the ability of doctors to control their pain ."}
{"id": 15448, "article": "(CNN) -- J.C. Chandor is one of Hollywood's hot new names. For his feature film debut, \"Margin Call,\" he wrote the script and directed a cast that included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore. His work on the film, about a Wall Street firm facing collapse after an employee (Zachary Quinto) finds out its holdings are going to be worthless, has garnered him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. His next film stars Robert Redford as a man lost at sea. At 37, he may seem like a wunderkind, but the former commercial director has been looking for his break for 15 years. He spoke to CNN about how the film came together, the challenges of building tension and his promising future. The following has been edited and condensed from the original transcript. CNN: \"Margin Call\" had a great cast. Were there problems in attracting it? J.C. Chandor: Attaching actors was actually not really the challenging thing with the film. Getting actors to say yes is one thing, but having the money there and the crew there and have everything happen at the same time is where you run into quasi-impossibility. For a long time, we had the actors but no money. CNN: Jeremy Irons plays the head of the firm and pressures it to dump its bad investments on others so it can save itself. He's been characterized as the villain. Chandor: The interesting thing is that Jeremy Irons' character is right, certainly following all norms of common understanding of business ethics. He has a piece of information before anybody else does, there's a fair market value set for something, and he has a responsibility to his shareholders and his employees and his company to do something about that. The tension comes from (the fact) that the audience wants one of (the employees) to do something. Hopefully, as the information travels up the chain of command, you see (the characters) in their own way regretting, or glossing over and moving on, or all the different emotions that happen when you see your own role in a tremendously damaging event. CNN: Your background was making commercials. Any we'd recognize? Chandor: I never was a very prominent commercial director, to say the least. I did a lot of things for energy drinks and Subaru, rally racing and Red Bull. Lots and lots of different industrials. If it was underpaid and under-budgeted, I was doing it. CNN: Now that you're an Oscar nominee, are projects now falling into your lap? Chandor: Yeah. Amazingly, this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae. The reception to my script once we were in production was very strong. The biggest trick in the game, even at studio films, is to try and get actors attached to your piece. We had managed to attract this cast without any money, without a studio, without anything else. It's been a slow, pleasant climb over the last two years since we shot the film. The film was very well received for what it was, which has allowed me to direct again, and everybody made their money back, so I've been pretty blessed from that standpoint. So now we gotta go keep trying to get the opportunity to do this again.", "reference": "J.C.

An anti-drugs politician admitted yesterday he used to smoke marijuana. Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman said he used cannabis when he was younger but now tries to educate children on the dangers of drug use. In 1996, Portman founded the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati after 16-year-old Jeff Gardner died from huffing gasoline and smoking marijuana. When asked whether he had ever taken the drug, Portman told Buzzfeed: 'Uhh... yes. I think I've been asked that now, in 20 years, three times. 'I'm very involved, as you may know, on drug prevention. I have been since my first year in Congress.' Previously, the Senator said he did not buy or sell the drug and rarely smoked it. He started actively campaigning against drug use when he returned to Ohio in 1996 after a stint as President George Bush Snr's deputy assistant and director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Portman founded the coalition in 1996 and it has since promoted drug-free environments for young people through education. He previously said of the organisation: 'I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to take action. Bill Clinton, pictured left with George Bush Snr, said he smoked cannabis as a student but 'did not inhale' 'Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.' Portman joins two Presidents who have admitted to smoking marijuana. President Barack Obama admitted using the drug as a teenager in his 1995 autobiography, Dreams From My Father. He wrote about some of his smoking haunts, including 'a white classmate’s sparkling new van', 'in the dorm room of some brother' and 'on the beach with a couple of Hawaiian kids'. In his memoir, Dreams Of My Father, Barack Obama said he smoked cannabis when he was a teenager . 'Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it,' he adds in the memoir. Bill Clinton famously admitted smoking marijuana but 'not inhaling' while a studying at university in England. While Governor of Arkansas, he said: 'When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and didn't like it. I didn't inhale and I didn't try it again.'", "reference": "Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman said he has tried cannabis .\nBut said he is now 'very involved on drug prevention'\nJoins President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in admitting using the drug ."}
{"id": 15451, "article": "A 35-year-old man was shot and killed by authorities in Northern California after he struck a police dog with a claw hammer and then swung it at an officer. Police were responding to a family disturbance call that an intoxicated man was destroying the residence with a hammer when they found Matautu Nuu outside wielding the tool. After Nuu refused officers requests to drop the weapon, shouting 'shoot me, shoot me', they deployed a Stockton police K9 named Nitro to take him down. Nuu then struck the canine's nose and cut him on the snout, said police spokesman Joe Silva. Matautu Nu, 35, was shot by two Stockton police officers after hitting police K9 dog Nitro (pictured) on the nose with a hammer . Officers John Griffin and Jason Schaffer fired their tasers at Nuu but it had no effect, Mr Silva told News10 ABC. Nuu was about to strike Nitro's handler, who had rushed in to save the dog, when the officers shot him down. First aid was immediately administered on the scene before Nuu was taken to a hospital where he later died of his wounds, Mr Silva said. The three-year-old Dutch Shepherd was taken to an emergency veterinarian and has been reunited with his owner. Nuu's family witnessed the incident and said the shooting was unnecessary, they told Fox40. They said the outcome would have been different if the police had let them talk to Nuu. 'What do we do right now? We lost a loved one, you know?' Karisamasi Nuu, Matautu's sister, said. She said Nuu's brother wanted to speak to him because 'he's the only one who could calm him down,' but the officers refused. 'Why did they not give us that choice?' she asked. As Nuu was about to strike the dog's handlers the officers shot him down outside his family's home on Martinique Court in Stockton, California (pictured) One  witness who asked to remain unidentified told Fox40 the family was screaming at police that 'he just has a hammer' and was begging Nuu to put the tool down. Mr Silva described the incident as dangerous because Nuu was 'vandalizing a house, which actually elevates the danger even a little bit more for people inside the residence'. He said things turned 'real violent' after Nuu attacked Nitro and 'got ready to attack' his handler. The officers have been placed on three-day administrative leave and there will be a multiagency investigation of the incident. Mr Silva said both actions are standard procedure for any shooting that involves officers. Nuu had been arrested twice for public intoxication in 2014, as well as for battery on an officer and resisting arrest in 2008. This week protesters called for the resignation of the chief of the Stockton Police Department after a number of recent officer-involved shootings.", "reference": "Matautu Nuu was 'destroying' his family's home in Stockton, California when police were called .\nOfficers found Nuu outside and asked him to drop hammer but he refused .\nReleased K9 police dog to take him down but he cut it on the snout ."}

{"id": 15456, "article": "(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai dismissed calls for negotiations with the Taliban, saying neighboring Pakistan is the key to peace talks with the insurgency, the presidential press service said in a statement Saturday. \"The people of Afghanistan say 'president, you have called for peace but peace with who?'\" according to the statement. \"I don't have another answer for them, except to say that it is Pakistan we have to approach. We cannot find Mullah Omar. Where is he? We don't know where the Taliban Shura is.\" The comments came the same day Afghanistan's intelligence service said it provided evidence that the assassination of former Afghan President Berhanuddin Rabbani was planned by the Taliban council in Quetta, Pakistan. Rabbani, who was spearheading the reconciliation process with the Taliban, was killed in a suicide bomb attack at his home on September 20. Police said the bomber claimed to be a Taliban member who had come for the talks about peace and reconciliation and detonated the explosives as he entered the home. \"We have given the evidence to the Pakistan Embassy in Afghanistan to cooperate with us,\" Lutfullah Mashal, Afghanistan's intelligence service spokesman, told reporters. \"We have concrete evidence that (Taliban council in Quetta) was responsible for killing the head of the peace council.\" Among the evidence turned over to Pakistani officials were photographs, documents, maps and the location where Rabbani's killing was planned, Mashal said. Long an enemy of the Taliban, Rabbani was a controversial choice when appointed by Karzai as chairman of the High Peace Council a year ago. He was forced to flee Kabul when the Taliban took over in 1996, but he continued to lead resistance to the regime from his stronghold in Faizabad in northern Afghanistan. Rabbani's death shocked the war-torn country, undermined the fledgling peace initiative and stoked fears of renewed ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and others, such as Rabbani's ethnic group of Tajiks. Karzai believes any negotiations must be conducted with Pakistan since the enemy \"sanctuaries and operating places\" are there, the statement said. In the statement, Karzai condemned insurgent attacks launched from Pakistan's volatile tribal area that borders Afghanistan. \"We also condemn the attacks on Nuristan and Kunar from Pakistan, and have asked the Foreign Ministry to use emergency diplomacy and contacts to stop these attacks,\" the statement said. The comments by the Afghan president follow ones made by U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, who said last week that the Haqqani network -- which has carried out a number of high profile terror attacks in Afghanistan -- acted \"as a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence.\" Pakistan's prime minister has rejected Mullen's accusations. Western counterterrorism officials believe that contrary to Pakistan's assertions, the Haqqanis rely on Pakistani territory -- specifically the tribal areas of North Waziristan and the Khurram agency -- to organize, resupply and raise funds.

{"id": 15457, "article": "(CNN) -- The Vietnam War began in the decade before, but the conflict, and especially U.S. involvement, escalated in the 1960s. For the first time, Americans witnessed the horrors of war, played out on television screens in their living rooms. This week's episode of \"The Sixties\" explores the war and its impact on American culture, then and now. Here are five facts from the episode that may surprise those too young to remember the Vietnam War: . 1. U.S. involvement in Vietnam began with Eisenhower. In the late 1950s, during the Eisenhower administration, Vietnam had split into North Vietnam, which was communist, and South Vietnam. Cold War anxieties dictated that if the North Vietnamese communists prevailed, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall like dominoes. When he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy vowed not to allow South Vietnam fall to communism. 2. The United States and South Vietnam had Catholic presidents who were shot to death in November 1963. By the early 1960s, South Vietnam's conventionally trained army was no match for the Vietcong's guerrilla-style tactics. In addition, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority revolted against their president, Ngo Dinh Diem. They saw the Catholic ruler as a tyrant. The Western-educated Diem, however, wielded absolute power and rose to dictator level by the summer of 1963. The CIA discussed toppling the regime. With U.S. knowledge, Diem was killed by South Vietnamese generals on November 2, 1963. Kennedy immediately regretted Diem's death and U.S. support for the coup. Less than three weeks later, on November 22, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One later that day. Soon after, Johnson told a grieving nation, \"John Kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed, that America must move forward.\" 3. TV forever changed the way Americans viewed war . As casualties rose, the country increasingly turned against the war. The official line was that Americans were winning in Vietnam, but the evening news told a different story. \"What Vietnam did to America via television was introduce us to a new kind of America,\" said author Lawrence Wright. \"One that was not pure, one that committed the same kinds of atrocities that are always committed in war, but we had never allowed ourselves to see them.\" Reporter Morley Safer recalled the shock of witnessing Marines burn down 150 houses on the outskirts of the village of Cam Ne. An officer told the newsman that he had been ordered to level the area. Three women were wounded in the attack, one baby was killed, and four people were taken prisoner. Safer asked a soldier if he had regrets about leaving people homeless, and the soldier replied, \"You can't expect to do your job and feel pity for these people.\" Another soldier told Safer, \"I think it's sad in a way, but I don't think there's any other way you can get around it in this kind of a war.\" Americans back home were stunned when the CBS report about the Cam Ne village hit the news. After the broadcast, Johnson reportedly called then-CBS president, Frank Stanton, and said, \"Frank, this is your President, your boys just s--t on the flag of the United States.\" 4. Some Americans resorted to self-mutilation to avoid the draft. When the choices were Vietnam, jail or draft-dodging by going to Canada, some young men panicked and devised ways to fail the military's physical exam, including mutilating themselves, starving or pretending to be gay. The compulsory draft, which had been initiated during World War II, meant registration for young men was mandatory at 18. Working-class men were more likely to get drafted over those in the middle class because college students could get deferments. In January 1965, 5,400 young men were called for the draft. By December of that year, more than 45,000 young men were called. When the monthly draft call rose from 17,000 to 35,000 per month, young people across the nation began engaging in civil disobedience. On November 27, 1965, the March on Washington for Peace in Vietnam took place, attracting tens of thousands of protesters. 5. U.S. troops endured 120-degree temperatures while sitting in swamps. Facing temperatures sometimes of up to 120 degrees F in the wet jungle terrain, soldiers regularly became afflicted with infections such as ringworm. Author and Vietnam veteran Karl Marlantes recalled the difficulty of dealing with losing his friends on the battlefield. \"You'd throw them on a chopper and that'd be the last you'd see of them,\" he said, \"and so you were constantly shoving it down because if you didn't you couldn't function.\" Bonus: LBJ feared being remembered for his handling of Vietnam . Johnson, who made great strides with civil rights legislation at home, did not want to be remembered as the American president who lost Southeast Asia. In a taped 1965 conversation, Sen. Richard Russell told Johnson that he \"couldn't have inherited a worse mess.\" \"Well, if they say I inherited it, I'd be lucky,\" Johnson said, \"but they'll all say I created it. Dick, the trouble is, the great trouble I'm under, a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere, but there ain't no daylight in Vietnam. There's not a bit.\" Luci Baines Johnson on her father's legacy . When CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, who was called the most trusted man in America, traveled to Vietnam in 1968 and announced it was time for America to pull out, Johnson reportedly old an aide, \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.\" Journalist Marvin Kalb noted that Johnson \"realized he was no longer in charge of the war. The war was in charge of him.\" In 1968, Johnson announced that he would not be running for re-election.", "reference": "This week's episode of \"The Sixties\" explores the Vietnam War .\nU.S. involvement escalated in the '60s .\nLBJ: \"A man can fight if he can see daylight ... but there ain't no daylight in Vietnam\""}

The curvaceous figure which prompted outrage from viewers is covered by her demure wedding dress and as she leans forward to cut the cake, she beams like any other bride on her big day. This is stripper Keri Graham who yesterday blamed everyone but herself for turning Britain’s Got Talent into a sleaze fest. Mrs Graham said that her ‘classy’ dance routine was only made seedy when the ITV show’s judges David Walliams and Simon Cowell came on stage and prompted her to perform a lap dance. Scroll down for video . Demure: Mrs Graham with husband Gary on their wedding day eight years ago . The 43-year-old writhed semi-naked with one leg over Cowell’s shoulder after he rushed on stage, egged on by Walliams, following her performance and took a seat saying ‘let’s do it’. The married mother-of-one, who was on TV just a few weeks ago as a Las Vegas showgirl in Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, also said responsibility for the public’s backlash rested with ITV bosses for allowing her act to be screened before the 9pm watershed. Speaking for the first time following the backlash she told the Mail that she believed that the routine she had initially gone on the show to perform was not sleazy. She said: ‘My act was actually more about strength and balance, using my core strength. It was a hard routine and trying to make it flow and sexy. ‘But then the tone got lowered when Simon got on stage.’ Mrs Graham had gone on the show to perform a dance routine on a chair to explicit song Freak Me, during which she took off her clothes to show her underwear. Fighting fit: Keri Graham insists her act was not seedy . At the end of her performance judge David Walliams told Mrs Graham: ‘I just thought wouldn’t it be great to see Simon sat on the chair and you doing the dancing?’ After initially seeming reluctant, Cowell walked on to the stage and kissed Mrs Graham on the cheek, before sitting on the chair as Mrs Graham gave him a lap dance accompanied by Walliams. Viewers immediately took to the Internet to express their disgust at the lap dance, with one condemning the show as ‘Britain’s Got Sleaze’. Yesterday at her £334,000 four-bedroom detached home in Chafford Hundred, Essex, Mrs Graham said that she had sympathy with those complaining, but said it was ITV’s decision to screen it at around 7:30pm, hours before the watershed. She said: ‘I didn’t do it to upset anybody. I do actually understand some of the concerns. But at the end of the day I did not choose to put that on ITV. That was for the ITV bosses to decide, I did the act, they did not have to show it.’ She claimed that she had made sure that her skimpy outfit was not too revealing. She said: ‘Seriously, there is more sleaze in a Carry On movie, isn’t there? Actual bare flesh, boobs and bums. It was all about a bit of fun. ‘I went to a lot of trouble with my wardrobe. I had my cleavage covered and wore two pairs of shorts, one over the other, to make sure everything was covered. It looked sexy but classy.’ Mrs Graham, who has been married to her husband Gary for eight years, said that she only auditioned for the show ‘for a laugh’ as she was taking her 12-year-old son Callum audition as a hip hop dancer. ‘I ran it all by him,’ she said. ‘I asked that it was all OK with him. And he said I am really proud of you mum, you have to do it. All his friends at school are very supportive.’ However, it is not clear that all the family were quite so unembarrassed by the performance. After watching the show, her step-son Seamus, who works for law firm Mishcon de Reya, wrote on Twitter: ‘Ladies and Gents, my step mum ... *hides*’ Her husband Gary yesterday refused to comment on his wife’s performance. It is not the first time that Mrs Graham has appeared primetime Saturday night television. She appeared in four episodes of the latest series of Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway as a Vegas show girl.

Mrs Graham, whose stage name is Keri Gold, said that she was not ashamed of her work as stripping is now ‘very common’, but said that she now only works as a choreographer for a burlesque dance troupe. She said: ‘Stripping is something that I did do, something in my past that I’m very proud of.‘When you become a professional dancer they pay you hardly any money, so I was trying to pay bills. I’m not saying oh poor me I was destitute and had to do it. Actually I had a brilliant time and enjoyed it. ‘It is something that is very common now, it is not something that is so shameful now.

A spokesman for the agency said: ‘Keri was on our books, but left two weeks ago. It was her on Britain’s Got Talent.

{"id": 15463, "article": "By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 4:12 PM on 7th December 2011 . Insulting: Andrew Robathan has angered the Second World War heroes . A minister yesterday likened the campaign for Arctic convoy medals to Colonel Gaddafi being ‘covered in’ honours. Andrew Robathan angered Second World War veterans by saying Britain did not ‘throw around’ honours like the Libyan tyrant and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The Tory defence minister said the UK only awarded medals for ‘risk and rigour’ – prompting accusations he was ‘belittling’ the sacrifice made by thousands. Mr Robathan made the ‘sickening’ remarks as those who risked their lives on what Winston Churchill described as ‘the worst journey in the world’, took their fight for a medal to Westminster. More than 3,000 UK sailors, who faced treacherous seas where temperatures plunged as low as -60c, died to keep the Soviet Union supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front. Of 1,400 ships on 78 convoys, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945. If the convoys of cargo and munitions had failed, Germany could have defeated the Red Army and turned the full might of its military machine against Britain. Despite the Tories promising to strike an Arctic Star medal when they won power, ministers have so far snubbed those who served on the convoys. Even Russia has awarded commemorative medals to survivors. Only around 200 veterans are still alive. Hell in the Arctic: Apart from the appalling cold, British seamen were under constant threat from U-boats, warplanes and battleships . Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war . Caroline Dinenage, Tory MP for Gosport in Hampshire, used a Westminster Hall debate at Parliament to tell Mr Robathan it would be ‘utterly, utterly disgusting’ if the heroes went to their graves without being honoured. Insisting it was an ‘insult’ ministers had not kept their promise, she added: ‘It brings shame on our country. ‘At their age they should not have to fight for justice and it appals me that people who gave up so much to ensure the freedoms we take on a daily basis for granted should have to beg for the recognition that they deserve.’ But Mr Robathan suggested the campaign was similar to notorious regimes which handed out so many medals it diminished their worth. He said: ‘The intention post-war was not to cover everybody in medals. Medals in the UK mean something. ‘Authoritarian regimes and dictators often throw around a lot of medals. One can look, for instance, at North Korean generals who are covered in medal ribbon, or Gaddafi, or Saddam Hussein. ‘We have taken the view in this country, traditionally, that medals will only be awarded for campaigns that show risk and rigour. 'Some regimes give out very large numbers of medals whereas we, traditionally, do not.’ Mr Robathan’s comments infuriated veterans watching the debate. Commander Eddie Grenfell, 91, the leader of the Arctic Medal campaign, said: ‘The man is a disgrace. Veterans are outraged that their campaign has been likened to former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's ostentatious display . ‘It was absolutely disgusting to speak of us in the same breath as Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein. 'They made a promise when they were looking for our votes and now they have betrayed us.’ Miss Dinenage said: ‘It sickens me that the veterans had to listen to those comments. 'They have demonstrated levels of heroism the minister could not begin to understand.’ Late last night Mr Robathan tried to calm the row, saying: ‘There was no intention to cause any offence. 'I was making the point that we honour people for their service in a very different way to that of authoritarian regimes.’ Successive governments have rejected pleas for an Arctic medal, claiming the sailors had already been recognised with the separate Atlantic Star medal. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Government would be holding ‘a fresh review of the rules governing the award of military medals’.

Bravery: Eric Alley made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943 . By IAN DRURY . Battered by waves as high as houses, the ships sailed on through the darkness, fog and appalling cold of the Arctic winter. But the weather was as nothing compared with the fear of being attacked by German warplanes, battleships and U-boats. A . total of 78 convoys delivered four million tons of vital cargo and . munitions to the Soviet Union – allowing the Red Army to repel the Nazi . invasion. The cost in . lives was horrific. More than 3,000 UK seamen were killed in the . treacherous waters of the Arctic Ocean as they undertook the terrifying . trips to keep Russia supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front. In total, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945. But . the cost had the Arctic convoys not succeeded would have been worse: . Nazi Germany would very probably have won the Second World War. Churchill proposed the convoys following Operation Barbarossa, Germany’s invasion of Russia. Cabinet . documents reveal that Britain’s greatest prime minister promised to . supply Stalin ‘at all costs’. He knew that if Russia fell, the full . weight of the Nazi military machine would be targeted at the West. Over . four years, the convoys delivered 7,000 warplanes, 5,000 tanks and . other battlefield vehicles, ammunition, fuel, food, medicine and further . emergency supplies. Because Norway and the Baltic states had been . captured by Germany, the only way to get the goods to Russia was through . the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel, both inside the Arctic . Circle. The first . convoys set off from Iceland and Loch Ewe in the Scottish Highlands. Two . or three reached their destination unscathed. But then the Germans ‘got . wise’ to the missions, said Eric Alley, 88, who served as a radar . operator on HMS Inglefield. ‘After . they woke up, all hell broke loose. They shifted all their most able . Luftwaffe squadrons and U-boats to Norway and we’d be under constant . attack from the air and sea,’ said Mr Alley, from Weymouth, Dorset. ‘You’d . hear a horrible bang and one of the ships would disappear. Once I was . moving across the deck and there was a huge explosion. I saw a column of . smoke and fire and one of the ships start to sink. The poor blighters . on board didn’t stand a chance. We heard ships call for help but . couldn’t do anything about it.’ Mr Alley, who made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943, said conditions on board were ‘pretty terrible’. He . learned the hard way about the freezing temperatures when the skin on . his hand was ripped off as he accidentally grabbed a ladder. The . final convoy departed from the Clyde on May 12, 1945, and arrived at . Kola Inlet, near Murmansk, on May 20. It sailed back into Glasgow ten . days later. Victory in Europe had been declared on May 8 – not least thanks to the sacrifice of the heroes of the Arctic convoys.", "reference": "Embattled Conservative MP said Britain only awarded medals for 'risk and rigour'"}

A woman votes in a church in Soweto during Wednesday's elections. But the ANC, led by Jacob Zuma, could see its two-thirds parliamentary majority reduced by the country's numerous opposition parties. The ANC has increased its share of the vote in every election since the end of apartheid in 1994. Leading the opposition challenge is Congress of the People, or Cope; a breakaway faction of the ANC which has capitalized as the ANC has been dogged by corruption and accused of failing to deliver services to the poor. \"People are taking this election very seriously,\" said CNN's Robyn Curnow. \"It's a pivotal election and the political landscape in this country has changed because of the emergence of the Cope party.\"  Voter shares feelings about ANC and new rival » . Voters stood in line for hours after a slow start, blamed partly on cold weather. Polling stations closed at 1900 GMT but anyone in line at the time was allowed to vote. The Independent Electoral Commission said the sheer number of people voting created long lines and a shortage of ballot boxes and papers in some districts and voting stations. The ANC's prospects have not been helped by the controversial election of Zuma to the party leadership last year. Until early this month, Zuma, who is practically the country's president-in-waiting, was facing fraud and corruption charges. The charges were dropped two weeks before the elections because of alleged political interference in his case. That decision by the country's prosecuting authority sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties accusing prosecutors of buckling under political pressure. But the ANC continues to command widespread respect and support among ordinary South Africans for its role in the struggle against apartheid and most consider the party of Nelson Mandela their political home. In an effort to shore up support for the ANC, the 90-year-old Mandela shared the stage with Zuma at the party's final pre-election rally in Johannesburg on Sunday. Mandela was also photographed as he voted Wednesday.  Watch Mandela vote with old activists and first-time voters » . First-time voter Lucas Nomblelani, a young black South African sporting the purple ink on his thumb that proved he had cast his ballot, said he found it hard not consider what the ANC had done for the country. \"Those people -- they fight for us,\" he told CNN. \"I'm here, I can vote. I don't have the soldiers here to force me to do something.\" He adds, \"Now we are free, all of us, to do what we want to do.

We can bite and I do believe the people of South Africa have heard our message,\" Cope presidential candidate Mvume Dandala said Wednesday, according to Reuters.com. Zuma, who is widely expected to be the country's next president, has already pledged his party will use its predicted majority responsibly and maintains he is innocent of corruption allegations. \"When I grew up, I did know that this day would come,\" he said as he voted in his village birthplace of Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal, Reuters.com reported.

Queuing up to vote in Soweto, Lulu Makapela said many people were disappointed by the ANC's failure to deliver on promises to deliver better housing, education and jobs. \"People have been giving us promises and there is a wide gap between rich and poor,\" Makapela told CNN.

The video called 'I Hate Thailand' drew more than one million views within days of being posted. But it was revealed the clip - which features an angry British tourist on a beach - was produced by Thailand's tourism authority, using a strategy of reverse psychology to attract tourists. Viral: The I Hate Thailand footage shows James eventually falling in love with the country . It comes after the country's image was battered by a military coup in May and the brutal murders of two British tourists on an idyllic beach on the island of Koh Tao in September. The five-minute video shows James revealing how his bag was stolen: 'I hate this place. I hate Thailand,' he tells a handheld camera. After mouthing off to a policeman, he meets an attractive Thai woman and eventually finds reasons to like Thailand. Reasons to like Thailand... in the footage, James meets and falls for a Thai woman . In the end, the unshaven, bare-chested foreigner cleans up, puts on clothes, befriends the locals and gets his bag back - wallet, passport and all. Several Thai newspapers reported the video as a real news item last week, prompting the Tourism Authority of Thailand to issue a press release on Monday saying it was behind what it called the 'romantic-comedy short film'. 'There's been much hype and speculation following the release of the I Hate Thailand video,' TAT Governor Thawatchai Arunyik is quoted as saying. Idyllic: Thailand is expecting to record a drop in  number of tourists this year due to the country's poor image . 'The intention of this video is solely to depict the renowned Thai hospitality.' The tourism authority said it was inspired by research showing that 'unbranded' advertisements tend to receive more interest than conventional commercials. The video, which bears no indication of being funded by the Thai government, was posted on a YouTube account that also gave no clue of ties to officialdom. The strategy is part of a massive campaign to restore Thailand's battered image overseas and revive tourism, which accounts for about seven per cent of the economy. The tourism authority has forecast that tourist arrivals for 2014 will drop for the first time in years, after a record year in 2013 when 26.7 million visitors came to Thailand.", "reference": "Video shows 'James', who has lost his bag containing wallet and passport .\nHis anger with the country subsides as local help him recover property .\nMilitary coup and tourist murders have tarnished country's image ."}

More than £1.4 trillion has been spent on welfare payments since the turn of the century, the equivalent of every single person in the country paying out £22,500. The staggering sum – which includes state pensions, disability support and jobless benefits – is close to all the money made by Britain’s economy in a single year. Benefits spending has nearly doubled over the past decade to reach £157 billion last year, more than is spent on health and transport combined. More than £1.4 trillion has been spent on welfare payments since the turn of the century, the equivalent of every single person in the country paying out £22,500 . Official figures show the Isle of Wight as the unlikely welfare capital of Britain because of its many retirees. But when payments made to the elderly are excluded Liverpool is the country’s benefits hotspot. Sickness benefits are highest in old mining towns in Wales and County Durham while inner-city Birmingham gets the most dole money. Ministers insist they are carrying out the most radical reforms to the welfare state in 70 years: introducing a £500-a-week cap, forcing those signed off work sick to undergo tough assessments, introducing a simplified universal credit and by cutting child benefit for millions. But some experts believe they must go further as the population ages and millions languish out of work. Even the richest pensioners remain entitled to the winter fuel payment (at least £100 annually), a basic state pension (£110 a week) and free bus passes, while just this week Ministers pledged to extend free school meals to all children aged between five and seven as part of a £1 billion giveaway. Labour leader Ed Miliband announced this weekend that if his party wins the next Election it will scrap the so-called ‘bedroom tax’. Official figures show that when payments made to the elderly are excluded Liverpool, pictured left,  is the country's benefit hotspot, while the Isle of Wight, right, is the unlikely welfare capital of Britain because of the number of retirees . Doing so would add another £470 million to the annual welfare bill. Matthew Oakley, head of economics at Policy Exchange, David Cameron’s favourite think-tank, said: ‘If we are ever going to bring spending under control, we need to continue to reduce how much we spend on benefits. ‘Firstly it will mean making sure people who are mentally and physically able to work do all they can to wean themselves off benefits completely. ‘Some jobseekers are spending less than an hour a week looking for work. This is unacceptable. Even the richest pensioners remain entitled to free bus passes . 'Some claimants should have to spend more time in job centres. Others with little or no experience of working should be made to do community work for their benefits. ‘Secondly we need to tackle the rising cost of the state pension. It is expected to rise by £40 billion in the next 50 years. 'This means we need to both face up to the fact that we can’t afford universal perks like the winter fuel allowance and to accept that we all need to continue to work later in our lives.’ Patrick Nolan, chief economist of the think-tank Reform, added: ‘I think that while the Government has made some good moves they need to go much further and look at areas that have been politically off-limits, particularly around pensioner benefits.’ This graphic shows which areas have the largest welfare bills . Figures published by the Department for Work and Pensions show the massive growth of the welfare state. In 2000-01, as Labour started to roll out Gordon Brown’s complex system of tax credits, payments stood at £81.1 billion. Of this, £38.7 billion went on state pensions. Within a few years the total topped £100billion and on the eve of the last General Election in 2010 it had reached £146.2 billion. Ruth Porter, communications director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘These figures are startling. They show throwing more money at poverty isn’t the answer.’ Liam Byrne, Labour’s Work and Pensions spokesman, said: ‘We’ll judge our success not by the money we spend but by the difference we make. 'We’ll put the social security system back on an even keel, once again setting a course for full employment, a living wage and a revolution in homebuilding.’ But a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Labour spent 13 years in government pouring billions of pounds into the benefits system and, in doing so, trapping the very people it was designed to help into cycles of worklessness  and dependency. ‘Our welfare reforms are returning much-needed fairness into the system and giving people an incentive to go back to work.’", "reference": "Benefits spending has nearly doubled over the past decade to reach £157 billion last year .\nMinisters insist they are carrying out the most radical reforms to the welfare state in 70 years .\nEven the richest pensioners remain entitled to the winter fuel payment .\nLiverpool is the country’s benefits hotspot when pensions are excluded ."}

But despite the potentially astonishing discovery, the man's two daughters - whom he has never contacted since disappearing - have refused to take a DNA test to prove his identity. The wife and daughters of Sgt.

'Somebody . suggested to me maybe that's (because) the daughters don't want to know . if it's him,' said Jorgensen. 'It's kind of like, \"That was an ugly war. It . was a long time ago. We just want it to go away\". 'I . don’t know. What would compel you not to want to know if this person is . your biological father?' Scroll Down for Video . Discovery: Special Forces Green Beret Master Sgt. John Hartley Robertson is the subject of a documentary which claims to have found him alive - now revealed as incorrect - 44 years after he supposedly died in Vietnam . Mystery no More: Dang Tan Ngoc (pictured) has been revealed to be an imposter who had repeatedly tried to impersonate a MIA Vietnam veteran . Sgt. Robertson's name is etched along . with 60,000 others onto Washington D.C.'s poignant Vietnam memorial, . but now the documentary questions whether he is actually alive and well. The filmmakers claim to have tracked . him down to south-central Vietnam - where the 76-year-old is unable to . remember his birthday, his American children’s names, or how to speak . English. The makers of 'Unclaimed' say that . the wiry, forgetful man could very well be a missing POW from the . distressing conflict, and that fellow servicemen could 'lose their minds' when they hear the story of how he never returned . home. 'Sgt. Robertson' told Emmy-award winning filmmaker Michael Jorgensen that when his flaming helicopter crashed to the ground during a firefight on a Laos mountaintop, he was captured immediately by North Vietnamese soldiers. Fake? Robertson, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and member of an elite MACV-SOG unit, was listed as Missing In Action in 1968. But a fellow Vietnam vet who claims he has met a man claiming to be him set off a media storm on Tuesday . Out of sight: Dang Tan Ngoc (pictured) claims to be Robertson, but has forgotten how to speak English . 'They locked me up, high in the forest, . in a cage,' he said. 'I was in and out of consciousness from torture and . starvation. The North Vietnamese soldier hit me on the head with a . stick, shouting, \"American!\" 'Then he would hit me even harder; I thought . I would die. I never said anything, though they beat and tortured me.' Mr . Robertson said he escaped after four years, hid in the woods and was . found in a field by a woman who nursed him back to health and then . became his wife. He said he borrowed her late husband’s surname and birth date and was registered as a French-Vietnamese resident named Dan Tan Ngoc. The couple then had children but no recorded attempt was made to contact his wife or children back home in America. Search: Vietnam veteran and humanitarian Tom Faunce, pictured, has become obsessed . with proving that the 76-year-old man he has found in Vietnam is indeed . Sgt. John Hartley Robertson . John Hartley Robertson was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 25, 1936, and went by the name of Johnny. He was the third of five children born to John Cheslea and Mildred Robertson. He grew up during World War II, and it was this influence that led him to drop out of high school at 17 so he could get his GED and join the Army, according to the film makers. He went on to join the U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, and was later chosen to join an elite Special Operations Group known as Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG). On May 20, 1968, he was on a mission when his helicopter came under enemy fire and crashed. A full search mission was not possible and he was declared Missing in Action. On April 28, 1976, he was officially declared dead by the military, leaving behind a wife, Wanda Robertson, and two daughters. The documentary follows the quest of . Vietnam veteran Tom Faunce as he seeks to prove that the man he first . heard about in 2008 while on a humanitarian mission was indeed a fellow . serviceman. Fonce . contacted Jorgensen to see if the filmmaker would follow his story to . establish that Robertson was still alive - but at first the director was . cautious. 'The MIA story was pretty unbelievable, pretty grandiose,' he said to the Globe and Mail. 'I was very skeptical.' However, what struck Jorgensen more than the idea a Vietnam veteran could have stayed undetected for 44 years was Faunce's own journey as a soldier, alcoholic and victim of child abuse. Jorgensen said he was inspired by how Faunce would 'go all the way in helping someone he didn't even know.' He added that 'no matter how the story turned out with John, I knew there was just a great \"once upon a time\" with Tom.' In Vietnam, Faunce tracked down the man who was locally rumored to be a former American Green Beret who had never returned home. 'Tom went to meet him and was very skeptical, grilled this guy up and down trying to get him to break, to say, \"Oh, no, I’m just making it up.\" And he was adamant he was that guy,' Jorgensen told The Toronto Star.

Soldier: Robertson is pictured left in 1968 - the year he was declared missing after his helicopter crashed . As the director delved further into the bizarre story, he discovered unusual evidence for Robertson's claims. He found that reports existed as early . as 1982 of Robertson's alleged survival, leading him to question why his . family were not contacted to help provide proof. 'Why did the Americans leave him there for all those years?' Jorgensen asked The Globe and Mail. 'Are there other John Hartley Robertson's in Vietnam?' Jorgensen answered his own question, adding 'a highly-placed source has told him there are and it's not because the Vietnamese won't let them go, it's more the U.S. Military doesn't want them to come home'. Indeed, Jorgensen said that the U.S. government . first became aware of the man as early as 1991, and tried to verify his . identity in 2006. The team discovered that in 2010 Robertson was fingerprinted at the U.S. Embassy. His siblings were never informed. Faunce was reportedly told that there was not enough proof to confirm this was John Hartley Robertson - to which they replied that there was not enough evidence to suggest he wasn't. As the film proceeds, stronger personal reunions add to the case that the elderly man who seems to suffer from dementia is indeed the American special forces solider. Jean Robertson Holley, said she will not have a DNA test as she knows it's him . Younger years: Jean and her younger brother are pictured center while growing up in Alabama . There is a tearful reunion with a soldier who Robertson trained in 1960 - who claims he knew it was him on sight. And . there is a moving moment when the man is brought back together with his sister, . 80-year-old Jean Robertson Holly, at her home in Canada - who would have . been Sgt. Robertson's only surviving sister. 'Jean . says... \"There’s no question. I was certain it was him in the video, but . when I held his head in my hands and looked in his eyes, there was no . question that was my brother\",' Jorgensen told the Toronto Star. This could be confirmed if Robertson-Holly agreed to DNA . testing, but she said she does not need to take the test to know the man is her brother. Jorgensen recruited a Vietnamese speaking police officer from Edmonton to act as a translator. At work: Cinematographer Allan Leader and filmmaker Michael Jorgensen pictured in Vietnam in 2012 . Film: Jorgensen's film, Unclaimed, will be showed at Toronto's Hot Doc's festival on Tuesday evening . Questions: Faunce walks along the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington D.C. The translator, Hugh . Tran, said that the elderly man spoke just like a Vietnamese native with no trace of . an American accent - leading him to become very suspicious. 'I still didn’t believe...  until I saw the family reunion,' said Tran about the emotional meeting with his sister. Other moments made Jorgensen believe they had the right man. At the family reunion, Robertson also met his sister's husband, Henry, and told him that he remembered him working in a drugstore. Henry did indeed work for as a pharmacist for 15 years. And when shown pictures of his two American daughters, he reportedly cried. Jorgensen said he believes that no matter what viewers take away from the film, which opens on Tuesday at the Toronto Hot Docs festival, the man who claims to Robertson fulfilled his wish: to see some of his American family before he dies. Heroes: American flags stand at the base of a statue of American Soldiers of the Vietnam War in D.C. Hot Docs director Chris McDonald, . said he had never seen an audience react with so much emotion after . seeing the film of Mr Robertson's life.

A sanctuary that has cared for unwanted animals for 64 years may be forced into the heartbreaking decision to put down all its dogs – because of one complaint about barking. Twin sisters Pat Hartley and Jane Wright have been issued with a council noise abatement order which they say they cannot afford to comply with. It means they must find homes for their 17 dogs or have them destroyed. They fear they may even be forced to close Mill House Animal Sanctuary, which is also home to 10 cows, 10 ponies, seven pigs, five sheep, five llamas and three goats. Tragic: Jane Wright of Mill House Animal Sanctuary admits 17 dogs like Polly face being put down because a council said their barks are too loud . The 70-year-old sisters say the complaint from a neighbour about the barking is the only brush with authority they have had since they started the sanctuary in 1948. Despite this, their local council issued the noise abatement order and told them to put up a soundproof perimeter fence. Unfortunately, their registered charity cannot afford to fight the order in court and doesn’t have the funds to pay for fencing. The sanctuary, in Fulwood, Sheffield, costs £3,000 a week to run and, although they receive donations, the sisters and their husbands prop it up with their own cash. Mrs Hartley,  whose husband Robert, 64, works as a driver, said: ‘We have a no-destruction policy. If we can’t rehome our animals, they stay with us until they die of old age. We have never turned any away. ‘But as things stand, we may have to put the dogs down and we could be forced to close for good. ‘We do not have enough funds to pay for a lengthy legal fight and in any case we feel the money is better spent caring for the animals.’ Mrs Hartley denied the dogs barked ‘all day, every day’ and insisted the sisters try to keep noise to a minimum. ‘We are in a quiet spot on a country lane, it’s not as if we are in a built-up area,’ she said. ‘The dogs do bark from time to time, all dogs bark.’ Attack: Patch may have to be destroyed before Christmas all because a single member of the public complained . Shame: The sanctuary cannot afford to fight the noise abatement notice brought against them, which makes the future bleak for animals like Alfie and 16 others . Home: The sanctuary has cared for thousands of animals like Sandy, pictured, since 1948 . Mrs Wright and her mechanic husband . Francis, 55, live in Mill House and say some of the dogs have recently . been moved from heated kennels to the house to reduce the noise to . neighbours. 'We have been here for 64 years and have cared for thousands of animals in that time – no one has ever complained before,’ Mrs Wright said. ‘We do our very best to ensure the noise is kept down. However, I have to concede that the dogs do bark from time to time. But it’s not like that all day every day as the person who has complained is claiming.’ The sisters say that, with Christmas approaching, they expect to have more unwanted pets to look after in the coming weeks. Home: The sanctuary has been asked to put up sound proof fencing - but they just can't afford it . Sad: The home, which has taken animals from all over Britain, has a no destruction policy but may have to shut leaving them with no other option . ‘We can’t turn them away. Putting up a fence is not a priority,’ said Mrs Hartley. The sisters lived in Mill House with their parents as children and were brought up with pet dogs and cats. In 1948, the family saved a young pony called Dolly because a neighbour was sending her to be slaughtered. She lived for another 25 years. The girls were only six when they took on Dolly and soon other unwanted ponies arrived and the sanctuary developed. Both sisters later had clerical jobs and used their money to run the sanctuary, which became a charity in 1982. Over the years they have taken in animals from all over the country, from the South Coast to the Orkneys. Heartbreak: Polly (left) and Poppy (right) and 15 other dogs face being put down thanks to the sole complaint . Cuddle: Rescued dogs Rocky (left) and Polly are cared for alongside a whole host of other saved animals . Desperate: Jane Wright holds Poppy and is keen to solve a problem that could lead to innocent deaths . Serious: Ossie, Patch and Polly are unaware that there lives could be short thanks to an order brought by one complaint . Mrs Hartley said: ‘We just love animals, we always have, and so did our parents. ‘When word got around that we had taken in a couple of ponies people starting contacting us about neglected animals and some were left at our gate. 'Over the years the animals took over our lives. ‘We don’t have the money to fight this case and we do fear the dogs will have to be put to sleep unless something can be done.’ A Sheffield council spokesman said: ‘A noise abatement order has been issued against the animal sanctuary. The owners initially appealed and then withdrew their appeal. ‘We are now working with the owners to help them comply with the order.’ Anyone wanting to offer a home to any of the sanctuary’s animals should call 07980 992589.", "reference": "Mill House Animal Sanctuary faces closure after council court order .\nOwners of the charity admit they can't afford to fight noise notice .\n'As it stands we will be forced to have to put the dogs down and we could even close for good,' owner Jane Wright said .\nSheffield City Council want them to install sound-proof fencing ."}

{"id": 15475, "article": "Atlanta (CNN) -- Everything about the rebooted Delta Flight Museum screams, \"AIRPLANES!\" Even outside its entrance, I'm greeted by aviation decorations. Lined up in a row like Roman columns are three struts of Boeing 757 landing gear embedded into the front of the building. Welcome to the Delta Flight Museum, home to some of the airline industry's historic jewels, including a first-of-its-kind aircraft that pioneered the sophisticated planes we fly on today. This could be the best aviation museum you've never heard of. I'm champing at the bit to see a few highlights, including: . • The cockpit from the first Convair 880-22, once the world's fastest airliner . • A nose-to-wing section of the first L-1011 TriStar that served as a Hollywood movie set . • The airline's beloved \"Spirit of Delta,\" a huge 1980s-era Boeing 767 . • Arguably the world's most meticulously restored DC-3, among history's most important airliners . Yep, it's enough to make an aviation geek play hooky and get lost among all the sleek, metallic technology. But this place also appeals to nonaviation aficionados, thanks to its collection of stylish luggage and Delta uniforms. Then there's the museum's JFK airport rescue project. I'll tell you about that in a minute. For years access to the museum was limited to Delta employees and their friends. But last summer the airline closed it for a complete overhaul. In June, it opened to the public for the first time. Appropriately, the museum takes up two hangars on Delta's corporate headquarters, next to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Once you step inside, you're met with an amazing 1940 DC-3 airliner called Ship 41. When sunlight pours through the hangar windows, it bounces off the aluminum surface of this twin-propeller tail-dragger. Beginning in the mid-1930s, more than 14,000 commercial and military versions of the plane came off the Douglas Aircraft production lines, popularizing airline travel across much of America. Each DC-3 seated from 21 to 24 passengers. Astonishingly, hundreds are still flying worldwide today thanks to an airframe that pilots describe as one of the toughest ever. The unbelievable airliner that just won't quit . Restoring this silver-skinned beauty was a triumph for a handful of retired Delta employees, who took it apart and rebuilt it in the 1990s, returning it to nearly as good as new. \"No other DC-3 in the world has been restored with such attention to detail,\" says the museum website. Delta says Ship 41 is the first aircraft to earn an award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Take a video tour inside the meticulously refurbished airliner . Next, take a walk through a darkened, circular portal and emerge into another hangar. Suddenly, you're sharing a room with a quarter-million-pound, five-story-tall Delta Boeing 767-232. It's right there in front of you, fully accessible for avgeeks who can't help caressing its underbelly and nuzzling up to its twin General Electric CF6-80A engines. A few interesting facts about this plane: . • In a gesture of solidarity, Delta employees raised $30 million to purchase it for the airline during tough economic times in 1982. • With a capacity of 204 passengers and six crew members, the plane flew until 2006 before retiring to the museum. • When you get on board, you walk through a first class section that's frozen in time. The armrests include passenger phones and audio controls. The bulkheads are decorated with pinstripes. A video screen is mounted on the wall. The sound system uses speakers mounted in the overhead bins. In the rear, the plane becomes a mini-museum, with displays featuring items like airline uniforms and insignia pins. Just steps away sits the cockpit from the first Convair 880-22, serial number 01. The Convair 880 was an unsung airliner classic, flying for Delta from 1960 to 1973. It was good enough for the king of rock 'n' roll. Elvis bought one in 1975, naming it for his daughter, Lisa Marie, and painting on the letters \"TCB.\" Just a little reminder that the plane was \"Takin' care of business.\" The museum's Convair 880 cockpit was the nerve center for the very first 880 test plane. Later the aircraft joined the fleet at TWA. \"Some of the other jets we'd compare to pickup trucks, but this was like a sports car -- like a Porsche,\" Capt. Frank Bottoms Sr., a retired Delta Convair 880 pilot, told me. Like a Porsche, the jet was a speed demon, with a cruising speed of 586 mph, according to the museum. In 1959, the 880 was known as the fastest airliner in the world, according to Popular Mechanics. Three years later, Delta set a commercial speed record with an 880, hitting 715 mph, according to the museum. That's fast even by today's standards. As Bottoms flew 880s in the '60s and '70s between Houston, New York, Chicago and Miami, the plane \"was something you were proud to be in,\" he recalled, calling it \"the cream-of-the-crop\" airliner. \"The passengers loved it, and we loved it.\" The museum also contains another piece of airline history you can't find anywhere else: a nose-to-wing section of the very first Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, serial number 1001. Oh, if this triple-engined jet could talk! It might tell stories about the test flights it flew for Lockheed in the 1970s. Or it might reveal tales about when it served as a movie set for 1992's \"Passenger 57,\" starring Wesley Snipes, and Bill Murray's \"Quick Change\" from 1990. Pilots loved the L-1011 for its efficiency and reduced engine noise. For a while, it was sometimes called the Whisperliner. Bottoms, who also flew L-1011s, said both planes were so reliable they could almost land themselves under the right conditions. \"They were such stable airplanes -- no wild gyrations of having to move the controls,\" he said. The museum offers several handy touchscreens with all kinds of cool data about the planes. But the best interactive exhibit is an actual flight deck simulator that was used to train Delta 737-200 pilots. If you're over age 16, a rare opportunity to \"fly\" the simulator for 45 minutes will cost you about $400. As you exit through the gift shop, notice another piece of history hanging above the doorway: a sign that reads simply, \"Delta Air Lines.\" It doesn't mean much, until you know where it came from. It was a rescue. Delta saved the sign from the now-demolished Worldport, aka Terminal 3, at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Built by Pan Am in 1960, the flying saucer-shaped building became a symbol of the excitement and glamor surrounding the early days of the Jet Age. Delta operated the terminal after Pan Am folded in 1991 until the airport tore it down in 2013 to create an aircraft parking lot. The sign was too important to leave behind. It's \"iconic and seemed to beg to be preserved,\" said Delta's Ashley Black. Workers carefully took it apart and trucked it nearly a thousand miles to Atlanta, where Delta's Technical Ops Center refurbished it to like-new condition, rewiring it with LED lighting. It all adds up to a surprising number of one-of-a-kind exhibits for a small museum tucked between the airline's corporate offices. Even for folks who don't get all hot and bothered about airplanes, it's a spot worth visiting during a long airport layover.", "reference": "Delta Flight Museum has recently opened near Atlanta's airport .\nExhibits include prototypes of important airliners, the L-1011 and superfast Convair 880 .\nMuseum offers an interesting tourist option during long layovers .\nGiant sign from iconic Worldport rescued from wrecking ball at JFK airport ."}
{"id": 15476, "article": "(CNN)It's a story that could have borrowed some of its plot from a Bollywood movie, but audiences might have scoffed at the improbable ending Krishna Poonia achieved in real life. A script containing some classic storytelling themes -- poor rural upbringing, family tragedy, arranged marriages and political ambitions -- was afforded its defining element when Poonia put in an historic performance at the Commonwealth Games held in 2010. In the entire 80-year history of the quadrennial sporting jamboree, no Indian female had ever claimed gold in a track and field event until Poonia snatched a momentous victory in the women's discus. Her winning throw of 61.51 meters led an Indian clean sweep in the event (compatriots Harwant Kaur and Seema Antil took silver and bronze respectively) and also ensured India's first win in the athletics stadium since the runner Milkha Singh, known as \"The Flying Sikh,\" dashed to gold in the men's 440 yards at the Games held in Cardiff, Wales way back in 1958. \"I can never forget that moment when I won the gold medal and when I took the victory lap with the flag,\" Poonia told CNN's Human to Hero series. \"For four years I was seeing the moment in my dreams and now I was finally seeing it in reality,\" she added wiping away tears from her eyes. Poonia could be forgiven for welling up given her journey from provincial backwater to a packed stadium in New Delhi. Born in the small town of Agroha in the state of Haryana, Poonia was brought up in by her father and grandmother after her mother died when she was just nine years old. Living among the Jat people -- a traditional agricultural community in northern India -- Poonia recalls a childhood where physical fitness was honed working the land not at play on a sports field. \"Most people are agriculturalist and their routine is to get up early and feed the livestock and after breakfast they leave for the fields,\" she explains. \"My family had a milk dairy and we had around 70-80 buffalo. The work of the milking was only done by the family ... and when I was (15-16 years old) I would help, milking seven to eight buffaloes in one go.\" School afforded something of a respite from this routine as well as providing an outlet for her growing interest in sport which was exercised further as she continued her formal education. \"When I got to college I used to compete with the other girls. My height and strength was good -- I could throw well,\" she explains. It was during this time that she got married, but rather than strangling her sporting ambitions, wedlock set them free. \"In our community we mostly have arranged marriages, but by the grace of god or luck my husband was a sportsman,\" she said. Virender Singh had been a promising junior hammer thrower who had won medals at Asian Youth Games before injury forced him into early retirement. But when he married Poonia his sporting energies were revitalized as he applied himself to the role of husband and coach. \"After getting married to Virender, I got to learn a lot -- he knew about the Asian Games, the Olympics and knew what it meant to win medals ...\" she said. \"When he told me about it I thought that I should be a part of it as well.\" With his knowledge and his unflinching support -- \"he had 100% belief in me,\" she says -- Poonia set about trying to achieve her newly-discovered sporting goals. There were setbacks along the way -- a back injury in 2000 almost finished her career and the birth of a son the following year meant she had to juggle parental responsibilities alongside training - but her commitment paid off in the long run. Bronze medals at the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games preceded her historic gold medal performance at the Commonwealth Games. More records were broken two years later at the London Olympics when Poonia became the first Indian woman ever to reach the Olympic discus final, eventually finishing a creditable sixth. The 32-year-old has since used her sporting fame to good effect away from the discus circle helping the Rajasthan state Health Ministry in their campaigns to curb the ongoing curse of female foeticide. The selective abortion of female fetuses is a continuing problem in India, and is particularly prevalent in Haryana where Poonia grew up, according to UNICEF. She has also been actively involved in trying to improve sporting facilities for children in Jaipur, where she lives with husband and their 13-year-old son, and across the country. \"If you see the schools we have in India there is no ground or fields for the kids to play in. Physical (education) isn't given much importance. It is said that childhood grows as you play and that's how sport starts,\" she says. \"I came from a village. If I can reach (the top) level then why can't other girls from villages do that,\" she says. Poonia's attentions have switched to politics in recent years, joining the center-left Congress party -- headed by Sonia Ghandi -- in 2013 and it looks like the final chapters of her sporting script may be being penned now, although she's keen to compete at the Rio Olympics next year. But the narrative that seeks to re-write traditional attitudes towards women in wider Indian society is only just beginning. \"For a very long time, the culture of our country has been a very male dominating one and the male child has been given a lot of importance,\" she says. \"Until the time we are not able to abolish the discrimination of a boy and a girl within the family this thing will continue -- (a child's) thinking develops from this situation.\" Poonia also advocates that dowries -- which are officially banned in India, though gifts to grooms and his family are still common -- should be put towards a girl's education so \"she is able to stand on her own two feet,\" she says. \"They say the first teacher is the mother. If she is educated she will give good virtues to her children she can change the atmosphere of her house. The base of our society starts from there.\" Few would argue with that assertion.", "reference": "Krishna Poonia became first Indian woman to win Commonwealth Games gold in track and field .\nPoonia won the women's discus final at 2010 Games hosted by New Delhi .\nThe 32-year-old now mixes sports career with political and gender rights campaigning .\nPoonia is a strong advocate of woman's rights to education and curbing \"male-dominated\" Indian society ."}

The city of Tuscson also honored the victims on the anniversary of the shooting today and rang 19 solemn bells as a tribute.

In his speech today, Obama said: 'It was four years ago today that Gabby and some other wonderful Arizonans were gunned down outside a supermarket in Tucson. 'It's a tough day for a lot of folks down there, we keep them in (our) thoughts and prayers.' The ceremony in Tucson took place at 10:10 a.m. Thursday and included a bell-ringing for each of the 19 victims of the attack. Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild also hosted a bell-ringing ceremony at a fire station downtown. 'I think it's important that we never forget what happened because there are a lot of lessons that can be learned from what happened,' said former Arizona Rep. Ron Barber, who was wounded in the shooting and who attended the ceremony. Peter Rhee, chief of the trauma at University of Arizona Medical Center, is the doctor credited with saving the lives of Giffords and others. Flowers, teddy bears and inspirational posters line a room at the Arizona History Museum in Tucson in this Wednesday, Jan. 7, to honor the victims . Standing outside the hospital Thursday, Rhee said he was changed by that day and thinks about it often. But he said many positive things came of the tragedy. 'The discussion on gun control is much higher on a national level. We can't just keep going on like this,' Rhee said. The Jan. 8, 2011, shooting shook Tucson, a city that considers itself a tight-knit community despite its half-million residents. Among those killed was 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, whose face adorns many of the memorial messages left at the shooting site and the hospital. U.S. District Judge John Roll and Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman were also killed. Barber, who worked for Giffords at the time, was wounded but later took over her seat in Congress. Jared Loughner was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting. Giffords, who was shot in the head, still struggles to speak and walk. She has become the face of gun control, having founded Americans for Responsible Solutions with her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. The items were left at the scene of the Jan. 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson that left six dead and 13 wounded . The gun control group raised millions for congressional candidates in the 2014 election, including Barber, who lost his seat to Republican Martha McSally. The group has garnered attention nationwide but has been able to do little to change gun laws. Organizers with the January 8th Memorial, a nonprofit foundation, are in the final phase of selecting a designer for a permanent memorial that will be placed at a downtown Tucson park. The foundation hopes to finish the memorial this year, manager Michelle Crow said. It will be at El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, but there are plans for other exhibits.

A black woman firearms officer said she suffered ‘13 months of hell’ before a criminal inquiry into her conduct was dropped yesterday. PC Carol Howard, 35, claimed the inquiry only went on for so long because she had successfully challenged racism and sexism in the Metropolitan Police. The officer, who was the force’s Olympics security poster girl in 2012, learned she will face no further action over claims linked to a dispute with her ex-husband. Last night, she said: ‘I’m appalled and disgusted that the police put me through 13 months of hell simply because I stood up to the Met Police and challenged the discrimination at work. ‘As a working officer, I know these allegations would not normally have been investigated in this way and for this long.

A claim of common assault was not pursued as the alleged incident took place more than two years ago and there is a six-month limit on the offence. A further claim that PC Howard possessed an indecent image of a child was dropped as the photograph was of her daughter. This month, the elite officer was awarded £37,000 for suffering appalling treatment in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. Judges found PC Howard was targeted for almost a year by a senior officer while working in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. The decision to end the inquiry is unlikely to be the final chapter in an ongoing acrimonious dispute between PC Howard and the force. The officer, the force's poster girl for the 2012 Olympic Games, right, claims the inquiry into her arrests only went on for so long because she successfully challenged the force over racism and sexual discrimination . She has accused the force of trying to ‘smear’ her by releasing details of her arrest at the hands of The Met and neighbouring Sussex. Senior officers are still considering whether to bring a misconduct case against her, something which could yet end her police career. Earlier this week the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced it will investigate the force over its handling of internal complaints. The tribunal found officers routinely deleted references to discrimination from reports, including one relating to PC Howard. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ‘We have advised Sussex Police that no further criminal action should be taken.’", "reference": "Carol Howard, 35, won race and sex discrimination case against Met in July .\nWas awarded £37,000 over treatment while in Diplomatic Protection Group .\nAfter she won, the force released details of her arrests in unrelated disputes .\nCPS says there is insufficient evidence to bring charges against officer .\nShe claims investigations into allegations only continued due to the tribunal ."}

A complete stranger who attempted to blackmail reality star Amy Duggar with 'incriminating and shocking' photos of her with a supposed older lover pleaded guilty in court today. Teresa Hunt, 49, was arrested in February after she contacted the niece of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, stars of TLC's 19 Kids And Counting. She told Miss Duggar she had photographic proof that the 25-year-old was having an illicit affair and wanted a $10,000 pay off. The pictures turned out to be innocent snaps of Amy with her singing mentor James Garrett, a John Denver impersonator 21 years her senior. Innocent snap: Amy Duggar, 24, pictured with her mentor James Garrett. Teresa Hunt tried extorting $10,000 from Discovery Communications over this image . Hunt faced one charge of extortion in federal court in Davenport, Iowa after trying to blackmail Amy and Discovery Communications, the company which owns TLC who make the Duggar family's popular reality show. Amy Duggar told the Quad-City Times that Hunt was a complete stranger to her. Mr Garrett had previously said that Hunt worked as a personal photographer for him, providing his publicity shots. Hunt's scam was revealed after an FBI sting where an undercover agent posed as an employee from Discovery Communications. Hunt claimed to the agent that three media outlets had each offered $3,000 for the pictures of Amy Duggar. Hunt then emailed the pictures unwittingly to the FBI with a demand for $10,000 to be wired into her bank account. Amy Duggar, a devout Christian, said that justice had been served, telling RadarOnline: 'It is a sad situation and it didn’t affect me at all. Forgiveness: The Duggars' niece Amy said she was glad justice had been served. She had always denied claims that were made about her and James Garrett, a John Denver tribute singer (right) 'I’m deeply saddened that she is going to have time in prison and I hope to God she gets her heart healed, whatever is hurting her.' Teresa Hunt, of Bettendorf, Iowa, told the judge that she had used anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication for 20 years. She claimed that there was 'two sides to every story' as she left court. Hunt is due to be sentenced on November 9 and faces up to two years in prison. James Garrett earlier told RadarOnline that he and Amy had enjoyed a good laugh that the photos would be considered incriminating but that the whole experience had been unsettling. According to Mr Garrett, Amy sang with the . John Denver tribute show in Branson, Missouri for four years and their . working friendship was strictly platonic and professional. Hunt had worked for Mr Garrett as his personal photographer providing . pictures for his billboards and magazine ads. Country singer Amy occasionally appears on the reality series as a guest star.

Initiative: Italian computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report Mafia activity . Italian computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report Mafia activity. The new site, Mafialeaks, will encourage victims, or even former mobsters, to relay information to police, anti-mafia magistrates and journalists without fear of reprisal. Mafialeaks is aimed at people such as shopkeepers or business owners forced to pay protection money, as well as members of the public who have uncovered mafia activity and former criminals who want to spill the beans on their bosses or partners. Based on the Wikileaks website, information provided to the site is directed through an anonymous coded network, to protect the identity of informants, and is then passed on to sources such as the police. The volunteers behind the new site have also kept their own identities a secret in order to protect themselves against any possible retaliation from those exposed by Mafialeaks. 'There are fewer than 10 of us, with families,' one of those behind the operation told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. 'Everything we do to do with Mafialeaks we do after work, using money from our own pockets.' A message on the website, which was down in 'maintenance mode' today, proclaimed that the purpose of the site was to collect information on mafia activity directly, with words in English reading 'if you know something, say something'. The site is accessible to anyone, with informants making their anonymous reports to 'receivers'. Site users are directed to one of three categories - 'whistleblowers', for those inside the mafia clans, 'victims', and 'know something', for those who have become aware mafia activity. They are encouraged to provide documentation of their claims, such as photographs, audio clips and other data. The information is then sent on to 'trusted persons', who will receive an alert that it has been posted. It is hoped that the list of trusted persons will include prominent law enforcement officers, journalists and anti-mafia campaigners. Volunteers hope that the site could provide information such as the location of Mafia bosses in hiding, or those behing extortion rackets. Origins: The Sicilian Mafia emerged in the 19th century, with activity prevalent in more prosperous areas such as the capital Palermo . However, there have been fears raised that the site could be abused by those involved in organised crime, and that mafioso themselves could deliberately give false information to confuse investigators. Magistrate Nicola Gratteri told La Repubblica: 'Mafialeaks could be a good way of spreading a certain type of information and shattering the wall of silence.' However, he also said it could be used to mask 'desires for vengeance'. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections.", "reference": "New site will encourage victims and former criminals to come forward .\nSite is based on Wikileaks and is accessible to anyone .\nVolunteers remaining anonymous to protect themselves from retaliation .\nFears raised that Mafia bosses could use site to put out false information ."}

Bank customers will be given more powers to demand a better deal under plans unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne today. People will be able to switch accounts in just a week if they find a better deal elsewhere. And the time it takes to transfer money and clear cheques will also be cut as Mr Osborne vowed to take on the 'oligopoly' of a handful of banking giants dominating the market. Scroll down for video . Bailing out: George Osborne used a speech at the JP Morgan offices in Bournemouth to say he would let reckless banks go to the wall . In what amounts to the biggest shakeup . of the banking industry in decades, he also threatened to forcibly break . up banks that break the rules. Reckless banks will be allowed to go to the wall so taxpayers never have to bail them out again. In a speech at the Bournemouth offices of JP Morgan, Mr Osborne said 2013 will be the year when the banking system is 'reset'. He said he wanted to see banks 'working for their customers, not themselves' as he set out the Government's Banking Reform Bill. The Chancellor promised to make it easier to switch accounts in just a week, and in future it should be quicker to transfer money and clear a cheque . In a bid to promote better . competition between banks, from September customers will be able to walk . into their bank and simply demand for their account to be transferred . to a rival. Mr Osborne said: 'We’re going to give customers the most powerful weapon of all: choice.' Crucially, . the bank will be obliged to transfer a customer’s direct debit payments . to the new account – ending the weeks of hassle associated with changing . accounts now. That . will allow people to shop around and get better interest rates, forcing . banks to offer better deals for customers to keep them. Consumer . watchdogs repeatedly complain that new customers are wooed with . attractive rates of interest, while existing customers are left . languishing on low rates. The system of wiring money between banks will also be overhauled, to stop it being dominated by a few big players. The ring fence between high street banks and high risk investment arms will be 'electrified' so if a bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank . Mr Osborne said: ‘Why, in the age of instant communication, do small businesses have to wait for several days before they get their money from a credit or debit card payment?  It should be much quicker. ‘Why do cheques take six days to clear? Customers and businesses should be able to move their money round the system much more quickly. ‘Why is it that big banks can move their money around instantly, but when a small business wants to make a payment it takes days?’ The Chancellor said he would ring-fence high street operations from the reckless ‘casino’ investment arms that caused the financial crash. In future no bank will ever again be ‘too big to fail’, he said. ‘When the RBS failed, my predecessor Alistair Darling felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out,’ he said. ‘Not just the RBS on Britain’s high streets, but the trading positions in Asia, the mortgage books in sub-prime America, the property punts in Dubai. ‘I want to make sure that the next time a Chancellor faces that decision they have a choice – to keep the bank branches going, the cash machines operating, while letting the investment arm fail. ‘No more rewards for failure. No more too big to fail. No more taxpayers forking out for the mistakes of others.’ The Treasury today published a bill to prevent taxpayers ever having to shoulder the burden of bailing out fat cat bankers. This will: . Vow: Mr Osborne said when the RBS failed, his predecessor Alistair Darling felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out . The legislation published today implements some of the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking led by Sir John Vickers. It is the result of a compromise deal between Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable. The bill will also contain plans drawn up by Andrew Tyrie, the Tory chairman of the Commission on Banking Standards, to ‘electrify’ the ring fencing of investment operations. That means that in future, if an individual bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank. The Chancellor said the previous regulatory regime – set up by Gordon Brown and Ed Balls – failed to prevent the last crisis. ‘The fire alarm was ringing, but no one was listening,’ he said. ‘And when the crisis hit, the fire was then so great that the whole economy was sacrificed to put it out. The British people need to know that lessons have been learnt. And they have.’ Mr Osborne acknowledged the level of anger among voters that bankers appear to have got away scot free despite wrecking the economy. But he will also argue that Britain needs a stable and effective banking system to help families and businesses and that bashing the banks will not achieve that. Royal Bank of Scotland will be forced to slash staff bonuses to fund a multi-million pound fine for rigging interest rates. The 81 per cent taxpayer-owned bank will this week be docked around £500million for its role in fiddling Libor. Mr Osborne has told the bank the portion of the fine paid to US regulators, likely to be around £400million, should come from bonuses. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, warned the threat to break up banks this would make it more difficult for banks to raise capital to lend to businesses and would also create uncertainty for investors. He said: ‘No other major economy is considering moving away from the universal model of banking because it undermines banks' ability to provide all the services businesses need. ‘Above all, what banks and business need is regulatory certainty so that banks can get on with what they want to do, which is help the economy grow.’ Labour claimed the reforms did not go far enough. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘For all the rhetoric and the partial climbdown he has been forced into, George Osborne is still failing to deliver the radical banking reform we need. 'He has refused to repeat Labour's tax on bank bonuses or implement our legislation on pay transparency. And he has failed to get the banks to lend to businesses, with net lending to small firms falling month by month.’ Choice: Customers will be able to switch accounts between banks more quickly . Bank customers will be able to switch accounts with ease under new rules hailed as a revolution for consumers. Currently, it takes 10 working days to switch an account from one bank to another, but this will be cut down to five in the autumn. Ministers have rejected calls for customers to keep the same account numbers because they feared IT hold-ups would have made the process much longer and put people off moving their accounts. As well as making it easier to move accounts, the Government plans to speed up the process of transferring money between accounts held at different banks. Officials are said to be outraged at the fact that it takes up to three days to pay money from one account into another, and point out that even in relatively poor countries such as South Africa such transfers take no more than 24 hours. The Chancellor also confirmed plans to encourage new banks to open up, increasing competition on the high street.", "reference": "Chancellor outlines plans to ring-fence high street from investment arms .\nHe threatened to forcibly break up banks that break the rules .\nBanks will be forced to allow customers to switch accounts within a week .\nTreasury set to publish bill to prevent taxpayers having to bail out bankers .\nAllow customers to switch accounts within a week with all their direct debits intact .\nScrap the Financial Services Authority, which failed to foresee the crash, handing regulatory powers to the Bank of England .\nSet up a Financial Conduct Authority to improve the culture and ethics of banking."}

For more than six hours the graphic designer passed on crucial information until the siege ended in a bloody shootout as the terrorist brothers, who had vowed to die as martyrs, burst out from their lair all guns blazing and were mown down in a hail of bullets. Police commandos stormed the print works where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen were holed up with a hostage and the terrorist brothers burst out from their lair all guns blazing . A huge ball of fire erupted amid gunfire and explosions as French special forces shot dead the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen . From inside his claustrophobic hideout, Mr Lepere had first sent a text message to his father when the Kouachis took over the print works at Dammartin-en-Goele, a small town just north of Paris. He wrote: ‘I am hidden on the first floor. I think they have killed everyone. Tell the police to intervene.’ It is understood he was in a locked room. He continued to provide vital information to police and special forces via his phone as snipers took up position on surrounding rooftops and helicopters buzzed overhead. Lilian Lepere, 27, hid in a cardboard box as the Charlie Hebdo gunmen held a father-of-two hostage for eight hours . Mr Lepere emerged unscathed from the shootout and was taken to a psychological assessment unit where it is understood he was to be reunited with his family last night. A hostage held at gunpoint by the terrorists was also freed. The Kouachi brothers had been on the run since killing 12 journalists and police officers in a terror raid on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday. As the huge manhunt for them continued, they dumped their stolen getaway car and fled on foot into a forest 50 miles north of the capital. This morning they managed to evade the huge police dragnet and just after 8am hijacked a grey Peugeot 206 being driven by a woman teacher near Montagny-Sainte-Felicite, 30 miles north-east of Paris. Jean Paul Douet, the mayor of the village, said a colleague saw the men force the woman into the back seat. ‘She saw their weapons, and in particular their rocket-propelled grenade launcher,’ he said. The teacher was freed unhurt soon afterwards, then dozens of police cars began chasing the fugitives along the N2 highway towards Paris. During the chase, shots were exchanged. The brothers dumped their car and fled on foot to a family-run printing company on an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele. They burst into the business – posing as armed police – and took the company’s boss hostage. Armed police surrounded the building and sealed off the town of 8,000 people. All businesses closed, nearly 1,000 children were evacuated from schools and the streets were left deserted except for lines of police vehicles and units of heavily armed officers clad in combat gear. Masked and helmeted troopers with automatic weapons were seen peering out of a blue helicopters buzzing overhead. Michel Carn, a resident, said: ‘The whole zone is surrounded. We are confined to our homes. ‘We can hear helicopters and there’s one currently hovering over my house.’ With so many low flying police and army helicopters, some flights were unable to land at Paris’s main Charles de Gaulle airport seven miles away. Incredibly, a salesman visiting the small print works office minutes after the gunmen seized it described an encounter with one of the fugitives – and even unwittingly shook his hand. ‘When I arrived my client came out with an armed man who said he was from the police,’ said the man, who gave his name only as Didier.

I guess it was one of the terrorists.’ As the standoff continued, police attempted to negotiate with the brothers but were told: ‘We are ready to die as martyrs.’ Officers also scrambled phone signals after the terrorists reportedly called with a criminal associate. As the siege continued, the town mayor’s office appealed on its website for residents to stay behind closed doors. Many workers were forced to stay huddled inside their offices and shops because it was too risky to venture onto the streets.

She was calm but me, I’m scared. I’m really scared,’ the woman said, sobbing. The siege ended at just after 3pm, as dusk fell.

'The gun has been brought over from America and uses an infra-red beam to judge the distance so you don't overshoot or hit them too powerfully – their welfare has been really carefully worked out.' Once the pony has been dosed a sharp-eyed assistant needs to retrieve the tiny dart. Ms Faulkner has previously spoken out in favour of eating ponies to save their species, saying a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home. 'Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,' she wrote in a letter to South West Equine Protection (SWEP), . The numbers of hill ponies have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today . The native ponies – not to be confused with their pure-bred Dartmoor cousins – are an essential part of the ecology of the national park by keeping the gorse on the moorland under control. But their numbers have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today. With ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation. In 2013 it emerged that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos and their hides were being crafted into 'wild pony' drums. Ms Faulkner said she believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a 'sustainable market' for them. The tails of the ponies shot with contraceptive darts are trimmed back to mark them out in the autumn. The initiative has been backed by Exmoor Pony Society and the Exmoor National Park Authority.", "reference": "Hill ponies are being shot with contraceptive darts on Dartmoor .\nConservationist Charlotte Faulkner said it was attempt to control numbers .\nShe said all owners must give their permission and ponies hardly feel dart .\nMs Faulkner previously said she is in favour of eating ponies to save them .\nEach gas-fired dart contains a dose of the contraceptive drug Improvac ."}

The move would clear a major hurdle for the normalization of ties between the two countries after more than five decades of estrangement. Cuba's leading human rights group said it had not been informed of any prisoner release since Thursday, when the total count stood at 41. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation has been keeping close track of the liberation of prisoners since they began last week, reporting releases within hours after hearing from family members or prisoners themselves. Most of the released dissidents belong to the Patriotic Union of Cuba, a vehemently anti-government group based in far eastern Cuba. Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of the group, told The Associated Press that his count was the same as the rights commission's and he knew of no release since Thursday. Scroll down for video . Free: Cuba has released all 53 political prisoners, the Obama administration said Monday. Aide Gallardo, left, and Sonia Garro, were two of the dissidents released . The releases have been shrouded in confusion due to both a U.S. and Cuban reluctance to release the names of those on the list. The prisoners had been on a list of opposition figures whose release was sought as part of the U.S. agreement last month with the Cuban government. They had been cited by various human rights organizations as being imprisoned by the Cuban government for exercising internationally protected freedoms or for their promotion of political and social reforms in Cuba. Speaking in Louisville, Kentucky, President Barack Obama's U.N. ambassador said the prisoners were released in recent days. 'Welcome as that step is, and heartening as it is for their families, (it) does not resolve the larger human rights problems on the island,' Samantha Power said, according to prepared remarks. Earlier, an official traveling with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Islamabad said the U.S. verified the release. Power was speaking Monday at an event hosted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. She outlined issues which the administration and the Republican-led Congress could work together on and issues they remained further apart on. Both sides want to advance freedom in Cuba, she said, but they disagree on strategy. 'Some of the embargo's staunchest defenders are Democrats and Republicans with deep ties to the island — people whose families came to America fleeing the Castros' repression,' Power explained. 'These are men and women who are completely dedicated to doing all they can to ensure that Cubans on the island get to enjoy true freedom. So it is important to acknowledge that while there may be disagreements on the best way to get there, we share a common goal of advancing the rights of the Cuban people.' Power said changes already are occurring in Cuba. When Cuban artist Tania Bruguera and other activists were detained after announcing an anti-government event in Havana's historic Revolution Square, she said, nearly 300 Cuban artists signed a letter supporting her freedom. Out: The prisoners had been on a list of opposition figures whose release was sought as part of the U.S. agreement last month with the Cuban government . Recent released dissidents Luis Diaz, David Gayselo, Miguel Tamayo, Vladimir Ortis, Aide Gallardo, Angel Casteyon, Sonia Garro, Mario Hernandez, Rolando Reyes, Carlos Figueyda and Eugenio Hernandez are seen together (left to right) on Sunday . 'In spite of genuine fear, Cubans were speaking out,' Power said. 'And the Castro government was forced to explain why it would rather arrest a woman than let her speak freely in a public square.' Last month, Cuba and the U.S. agreed to work to restore normal diplomatic relations as part of a deal in which Cuba freed an imprisoned U.S. aid worker along with an imprisoned spy working for the U.S. and the imprisoned dissidents. The U.S. released several Cuba intelligence agents. 'Certainly, for those 53 prisoners, it's a great deal. We don't know who they are,'Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in an appearance Monday on 'CBS This Morning.' Rubio said he supports improving ties with Cuba but said he's worried that the Cubans are getting virtually everything they want from the United States for 'these minimal changes.' He said he wants to be certain that improved relations between Washington and Havana provides equal benefits to the U.S. 'My interest in Cuba is freedom and democracy,' he said. Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who's considering a run for the presidency, said there is 'no current example' around the world where a \"government of resistant tyranny\" has moved to greater freedom and democracy as a result of changes in international relations that are based on economic incentives.", "reference": "Cuba completed the release of 53 political prisoners, the Obama administration said Monday .\nThe move would clear a major hurdle for the normalization of ties between the two countries after more than five decades of estrangement .\nCuba's leading human rights group said it had not been informed of any prisoner release since Thursday, when the total count stood at 41 .\nMost of the released dissidents belong to the Patriotic Union of Cuba, a vehemently anti-government group based in far eastern Cuba ."}
{"id": 15488, "article": "Australian scientists appear to have solved one of the great mysteries of human biology - exactly what triggers labour after about 40 weeks of pregnancy. They cannot explain how the timing works or predict a child's birthday with greater accuracy. But they know that, when it's time, the body produces a protein, which releases a safety switch that allows the uterus to contract in a way that any stretched muscle should. Australian scientists have discovered a protein that triggers child birth at about 40 weeks of pregnancy . This could lead to new drugs to induce labour in overweight or obese women, as well as a way to prevent pre-term births, says Professor Shaun Brennecke from the University of Melbourne and Royal Women's Hospital. 'For decades, we have been looking at what might start human labour. This is the first clear-cut identification of that. 'Rather than all the hormonal changes which have been talked about in the past, this is the actual switch that starts labour,' said Prof Brennecke, who worked with colleagues at Monash University and the Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle on the project. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, is aimed at finding alternatives to the dangerous caesarean sections that are common among overweight and obese mothers. The finding could lead to the development of new drugs to induce labour in overweight or obese women and also to prevent pre-term births . Overweight mothers do not produce enough of the protein molecule to start the chain reaction, said study leader Professor Helena Parkington of Monash University. 'These women also respond poorly to our current methods of induction.' The study gives two potential options for improving the labour of obese women, says Prof Brennecke. There could be an existing drug that can switch off the safety mechanism, or there might be one that increases the amount of protein produced.

{"id": 15489, "article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \"The Simpsons Movie\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont . Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\" he said. \"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\" Its creators hope that \"The Simpsons Movie\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof. I don't know what that says about humanity, but we do like to see cartoon characters hurt themselves and there's quite a bit of that.\" But how have Springfield's finest led the field for so long? Groening believes that a large part of the Simpsons' success is down to the traditional animated techniques used to create it -- and that its hand-drawn charm puts the movie ahead of its CGI rivals. He told CNN, \"The difference between our film and these other films is that we have no penguins, okay? So that's the big difference. (Although we do have one penguin.) \"But the other thing is, our film is done the old fashioned way. It's got a lot of errors and flaws in it. These computer-animated films -- and I love them -- are perfect. They're spooky, they're so good. Ours is a way for us to honor the art of traditional animation.\" Al Jean thinks that the series' success is also down to its wide appeal. He says, \"I have a two year old and she loves the Simpsons already, just because of the way it looks and the family. And then on the other hand, we do satirical references that only an adult would get.\" A large part of the appeal of \"The Simpsons\" comes from its ability to portray the more touching moments in family life, like Jean's favorite moment in the movie. \"It's a scene where Bart is really mad at his father,\" he told CNN. \"He's sitting in a tree outside the Simpson house at night. He looks over and sees the Flanders house and thinks how wonderful it would be if he lived there. It's just really sweet: there's something really warm about that scene.\" Groening, who has been meeting fans worldwide while promoting the movie, said that the Simpsons phenomenon has excelled his wildest dreams. \"It's not just the numbers,\" he told CNN. \"The numbers are good, but it's the intensity and the tattoos. The tattoos are freaky. You know? And it's not all just Bart and Homer. You'd think it would be just Homer. I talked to this one guy and he had Millhouse, and I said, 'Oh my god, Millhouse!' and he said, 'Yeah, everybody gets Bart.'\" While Groening never expected the series to run for so long, he told the Screening Room he has no plans to quit while it's ahead. \"The answer is, 'No end in sight! No end in sight!'\" he said. \"We're having fun, we hope the audience has fun, and as long as that's true, we'll continue doing the show.\" Jean believes the show has proved it has longevity. \"I'm sure [it], like Mickey Mouse, will live on and on,\" he said. And he also hopes the Simpsons' success will continue. \"In terms of new episodes, we're doing another season after the movie comes out for sure, and then the casts' contracts expire, but I'd love to get another three seasons and maybe another movie,\" he said. But what is the legacy of this much-loved yellow family? Matt Groening sees the film as the culmination of two decades of hard graft. He says, \"I want to make sure that everyone who's ever worked on this show is proud of their work on this movie, so this rewards the writers, the animators, the actors. It's basically a celebration of twenty years of The Simpsons.\" E-mail to a friend .", "reference": "Simpsons creator Matt Groening: Movie is culmination of 20 years' hard work .\nWriter Al Jean says success is down to show's universal appeal .\nMovie uses traditional hand-drawn animation techniques ."}
{"id": 15490, "article": "By . Sarah Griffiths . Children of the 1980s spent hours perfecting the art of playing Namco’s Pac-Man computer game. And now computers are teaching each other to play the popular game, which sees a player navigating a maze, trying to gobble up pellets while avoiding four colourful enemies. Researchers have managed to develop a method to allow a computer to give advice and teach skills to another computer in a way that mimics how a real teacher and student might interact - and are demonstrating it with video games. Scroll down for video . Game on: Computers are teaching each other to play Pac-Man (pictured) which sees a player trying to gobble up pellets while avoiding four colourful enemies, thanks to clever algorithms developed by researchers at Washington State University . The team, which was led by Matthew Taylor, Washington State University’s Allred Distinguished Professor in Artificial Intelligence, used virtual robots called agents to simulate the teacher and student relationship. The student robots initially struggled to learn Pac-Man and a version of the video game StarCraft, but the scientists were able to show that with time the student agent learned the games and surpassed the teacher’s abilities. Helping robots to teach each other to play games is an important and challenging are of research in robotics. Experts said that if robots could teach each other tasks, then they could learn to clean houses and make chores a thing of the past, for example. Pay attention: In the study, the scientists programmed their teacher agent to focus on action advice (shown in the text on the right of the screen) as well as giving it no advice so it could learn for itself . ‘As robots become more common, we want them to be able to learn quickly and any time one robot learns something we want to make sure that it can teach that information to another robot, because we don’t want this information to be lost,’ Professor Taylor said. In the study, which was published online in the journal Connection Science, the scientists programmed their teacher agent to focus on action advice or telling a student when to act. They said: ‘As anyone with teenagers knows, the trick is in knowing when the robot should give advice. If it gives no advice, the robot is not teaching. But if it always gives advice, the student gets annoyed and doesn’t learn to outperform the teacher.’ Professor Taylor explained that the team designed algorithms for advice giving and tried to work out when their advice made the most difference to make the learning technique as effective as possible. Must try harder: The team, which was led by Matthew Taylor, Washington State University's Allred Distinguished Professor in Artificial Intelligence, used virtual robots called agents to simulate the teacher and student relationship (illustrated) He aims on developing a curriculum for the agents that starts with simple work and builds to more complex tasks. His ultimate goal is to let agents teach humans new skills. But Professor Taylor said there is no need to worry about computers taking over the world because ‘they’re very dumb’. Even the most advanced robots are easily confused and when they get confused, they stop working, he explained. It often takes two or three times as long as he predicts to get the robots to learn and the easiest way of successfully teaching them new skills is to remove the ‘brains’ of the old one and put them in the new one. Problems occur, though, when hardware and software don’t work in the new model and this approach cannot be used in one of robotics long-term aims, which is to use robots to teach skills to humans, as we cannot simply insert their hard drives. Robots will be smarter than the most intelligent humans within the next 15 years, Google’s engineering head has predicted. Computers will soon be able to learn from experience, tell jokes and even flirt, according to Ray Kurzweil, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) expert. Google has spent billions of its £57billion fortune quietly buying up the world’s top robotics companies, including DeepMind, a British company which specialises in machine learning and Boston Dynamics, which makes advanced military robots. Prophet? Ray Kurzweil (pictured) predicts that the 'Turing test' moment - when computers become cleverer than us - will be passed in 2029 . The 66-year-old entrepreneur and futureologist, who predicted the rise of the internet and that a world chess champion would one day be beaten by a computer, has said machines will outsmart their makers by 2029. In an interview with The Observer, he said: 'My project is ultimately to base search on really understanding what the language means. 'When you write an article, you're not creating an interesting collection of words. You have something to say and Google is devoted to intelligently organising and processing the world's information. 'We want [computers] to read everything on the web and every page of every book, then be able to engage in intelligent dialogue with the user to be able to answer their questions.' Mr Kurzweil predicts that the 'Turing test' moment - when computers become cleverer than us - will be passed in 2029.", "reference": "Scientists from Washington State University developed a method to allow a computer to give advice to another computer .\nTheir method mimics the way a real teach and student interact .\nThe student robots initially struggled to learn Pac-Man but eventually learned the game and surpassed the teacher's abilities ."}

Janet Blank, 65, is the first patient to choose the distraction method during surgery at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Ms Blank was awake and ‘heard everything’ during her total knee replacement, which she had under spinal anaesthesia last Friday. A great-grandmother has used a tablet computer to distract her during knee replacement surgery instead of being sedated . During the two-hour procedure, the great-grandmother-of-10 used an iPad to listen to her favourite radio show. The benefits of avoiding sedation drugs include reducing sickness, drowsiness, and confusion after operations. Surgeons are also able to communicate with the patient during procedures. Ms Blank, who works at a local care home, said she would recommend the technique to anyone. ‘I heard everything, the hammer and drill but it didn’t bother me at all,’ she said. ‘I didn’t feel any pain and I actually watched the screen when they put the nerve block down my leg which was fascinating. ‘I went to the recovery room after the operation and then straight up to the ward.

The new iPad was on loan from the South West Regional Anaesthesia Group. Matt Oldman, consultant anaesthetist, said: ‘By avoiding sedating anaesthetic drugs during the procedure we can reduce side effects such as sickness, post-op drowsiness and confusion. ‘Staying awake may also be a safer option for patients with certain medical conditions. Another added advantage is that the surgeon can communicate with the patient during the procedure. ‘The use of spinal anaesthetics for this type of surgery is not new but until now we have not had anything to offer our patients as a distraction, and as a result many patients have opted to have sedation throughout the procedure to avoid hearing or seeing anything. ‘Typically, the procedures last between one and two hours, which is a long time to expect someone to lie still. But with the new iPads we can offer a choice of music, films and television using the trust’s free Wi-Fi.’ Ms Blank is looking forward to returning to her twice weekly gym classes and being kept busy by her 18 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. ‘I’m glad to get it over and done with.

Snapped by a fellow culture-vulture, the Facebook CEO wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back. The photo of Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg taking in Michelangelo's frescoes was just one many sightings across the Italian capital of the notoriously private social network founder. Roman holiday: Mark Zuckerberg and new wife Priscilla Chan look engrossed as a tour guide speaks about the Sistine Chapel on their honeymoon . Polish tourist Darek Rusajczyk posted the image to Twitter after spotting the social network billionaire and his wife, who is training to become a doctor. The couple were dressed casually, with Zuckerberg in his typical jeans and t-shirt (but missing a hoodie) while Priscilla wore bright red skinny jeans and wraparound cardigan. They were snapped listening intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings. The couple were also seen at the Colosseum and the Spanish Steps. Zuckerberg took his new wife for dinner at Pierluigi restaurant which has been an institution in the Eternal City since 1938. However the billionaire, 28, had come under fire for spending just 32 Euro on a lunch with 27-year-old Priscilla. The pair were spotted eating a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Roma's Jewish Ghetto where they were snapped by fellow diners. That's amore: Zuckerberg places a hand on his new wife's back as they take in the art at the Vatican . Tourist trail: The couple were casually dressed in jeans and t-shirts as they listened to a priest talk about Michelangelo's art . They tucked into a bargain meal of Roman-style artichokes, ravioli in an artichoke sauce and fried pumpkin flowers but they had no alcohol choosing instead water and tea. Within minutes of leaving the restaurant, the owner Umberto Pavoncello had confirmed the couple had paid a visit - while word also quickly spread via Twitter. The couple's 32 Euro bill - equivalent to $40 - was also posted on the internet by Italian news websites and Mr Pavoncello said: 'They seemed like two lovebirds. They shared a plate of artichoke ravioli in the centre of the table. It was a very romantic scene.'

Later the couple were spotted in Pierluigi's restaurant where staff revealed they dined out on a supper of prawns Catalan style, oysters and fish carpaccio, followed by lobster pasta and flame grilled fish washed down with a bottle of Chardonnay Gaia e Rei. Unlike Nonna Betta, staff at Pierluigi were rather more reluctant to reveal the cost of their dinner but it was thought to be in excess of £120 - service not included - with a waiter saying: 'It was just the two of them. 'They were happy and content. They had an intimate and romantic dinner.' Besides the Vatican were also spotted at the ancient Colosseum, as well as taking in the sights, sounds and colours of the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps taking photographs every few minutes. The couple are thought to have arrived in Rome by private jet and stayed at the luxury five star Portrait suites hotel close to the Spanish Steps which is owned by the family of fashion designer Salvatore Ferragamo with prices starting at 800 Euro a night.

Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o from Chelsea to Everton have proved successful buys so far, and Ba could have been the third. By Kieran Gill . Back in England for the second time since leaving Chelsea in the summer, the 29-year-old played as if he had something to prove. To himself, possibly. To the Premier League, definitely. He strutted around White Hart Lane as if there was only one man to settle this game. Only a string of Lloris saves stopped Bilic and Ba would have been leaving with three precious points, almost sealing their qualification from the group in turn already. In the end, it was left for the Senegalese to grab a point. On an evening he stood above the rest, that finale seemed fitting. The 2,800 travelling supporters went wild - a solitary flare was let off - as Besiktas, knowing the Europa League is a gateway to Champions League qualification for first time this season, earned the least they deserved. Bilic, when referencing the swell of support in the South West corner, joked afterwards that he wished there were as many fans in Istanbul as there are in London. Tricky to blame him given the noise projected from that area of the ground well before kick-off. They had been allowed in particularly early on Thursday night - a wise move after the scenes around the Emirates the night before - and it filled up rather quickly. With an hour to go there were at least 1,500 already out in their seats chanting away. That would give any team a lift. There they were, hollered on to their warm up - similarly so when the XI came out half-an-hour later. Ba thrived and meant business.

Tottenham were nowhere near touching their best - not surprising given the manager had made 10 changes - and, but for Lloris, might have come away with nothing. They missed something going forward, often lackadaisical in their approach and didn't have a focal point to hit. Harry Kane offered when dropping deeper into the No 10 but the consistent beige produced by Roberto Soldado must continue to concern. Pochettino said afterwards that he had 'all the information' needed on the players in his squad after three months working with them.

The Queen is set to receive an inflation-busting 22 per cent ‘pay rise’ over two years, according to new official figures. The monarch is said to be ‘down to her last £1 million’, leaving her vulnerable to ‘unexpected costs’, a report has said. She is now expected to be given £37.9 million in 2014-15 to run her Household and conduct official engagements, up from £31 million in 2012-13. The figures were released yesterday by the National Audit Office which has, for the first time, been allowed to examine all aspects of the Queen’s funding as Head of State. But while recommending the increase, their report goes on to highlight what it describes as ‘significant reductions’ in the monarchy’s funding over the last 20 years. It says that grants for royal travel on official engagements both at home and abroad has been slashed by 76 per cent in real terms. The maintenance for royal palaces, including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, was similarly reduced by an impressive 60 per cent. That has left, according to the NAO, a huge backlog in property maintenance, with 39 per cent of occupied royal palace being deemed below their ‘target condition’. In order to cope with the shortfall the Queen’s money men have been dramatically scaling back their spending, reducing net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms. According to the figures, that led to real-term expenditure of £32.9 million in 2011-2012, compared to £72.6million in 1991-92. In order to help meet the shortfall, the Queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings - known as ‘drawing down on reserves’ - over the years and is, apparently, down to her last £1 million in the bank. Queen Elizabeth II, shown meeting King Tupou VI of Tonga at Buckingham Palace. The National Audit Office has, for the first time, been allowed to examine all aspects of the Queen's funding as Head of State . The NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament and is independent of government, says this poses serious questions about the palace’s ability to cope in an unexpected crisis if, say, the roof of Buckingham Palace fell down. ‘As part of its long-term planning the Household may need to consider whether the Reserve is adequate to meet unexpected costs,’ it says. The NAO report will be put before parliament’s powerful Public Accounts Committee on Monday as part of as investigation into royal finances. Until last year the monarch was funded by a complicated combination of civil list payments and government grants. Following an extensive review of royal finances by the government, the Queen now receives one single pot of money known as the Sovereign Grant to largely spend as she wishes on everything from funding her office to repairing the palace roof. The maintenance for royal palaces, including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, has been reduced by 60 per cent over the last 20 years . In each of the last six years, the Queen’s programme has on average seen her conduct more than 300 engagements in addition to 3,000 trips by the rest of the Royal Family , six gardens parties and more than 26 investitures. The money is taken from the Crown Estate, a wealthy portfolio of agricultural land, buildings and property - ranging from a retail park in Liverpool to London’s Regent Street - which historically belonged to the monarchy but the profits of which have, since the reign of George 111, gone to the Treasury. This year the Crown Estate announced record revenue of £253 million . As a result of protracted - and sometimes combative - negotiations with Downing Street, the monarch is now, for the first time in two centuries, entitled to keep 15 per cent of its profits with the rest going to the Treasury. This year the Crown Estate announced record revenue of £253 million. Its entire holdings are now worth an astonishing £8.1 billion and the NAO says that profits are likely to continue to rise, meaning the Queen will enjoy further increases in funding to come. The palace insists most of its extra cash will be spent on a ‘massive backlog’ of repairs to royal palaces, which the Queen holds in trust on behalf of the nation. It has long complained of having to put off millions of pounds worth of essential repairs due to those real-term falls in funding. Buckets are frequently used to catch water leaks in the picture gallery while none of the state rooms, regularly used for entertaining heads of state, have not been decorated in more than sixty years. The new NAO report also highlights the royal household’s efforts to increase income through money-spinning schemes such as renting out its facilities for commercial events. This has generated a rise of 54 per cent in profits, £11.6 million last year alone. Other nuggets in the report show that the monarch’s 436 staff cost her £19.5million a year, although anyone earning more than £21,000 has had their pay frozen since 2011 in a bid to cut bills. Last year the family spent £4.5 million on travel, a real term reduction of 30 per cent in the last decade, as royals were told to stop using private jets and take scheduled flights instead. Of that £900,000 was spent on rail journeys last year and £1.6 million on helicopters. The royal train, which was used just 15 times last year at an average cost of more than £25,000 is now under review again. Joanne Harris receives an MBE from the Queen at an Investiture Ceremony at Buckingham Palace in central London yesterday . If you’re worried that your children or grandchildren will grow up more interested in iPads than fairytales, you’re not alone. In fact, you have an unlikely new champion – the Queen. She . has shared her fears that children are more likely to play computer . games or read e-books than settle down with a traditional story. It is highly unusual for the Queen to openly express an opinion on such issues. She . made the comments as she presented author Joanne Harris with an MBE for . services to literature at Buckingham Palace yesterday. Miss Harris is perhaps best known for her bestselling novel Chocolat. Asked . about her chat with the Queen yesterday, Miss Harris said: ‘She asked . me what I thought about e-books and computer games and said that she . feared children were playing with those more than they were reading . books. ‘So I told her that we start them on e-books and computer games and TV and then try to get them on to books later.’ She . added of her MBE: ‘It’s wonderful to be recognised and it’s wonderful . to see the world of literature be recognised every time this happens to . one of us.’ Earlier . this year, the National Literacy Trust revealed that most children . preferred to read on screens rather than from books, but those who used . the new technology had weaker literacy skills. And research published this week shows tablets have become a  ‘must-have accessory’ for toddlers. Half of Britain’s two and three-year-olds use one, the OnePoll  survey revealed. Chris Heaton-Harris, Conservative member of the Public Accounts Committee, who set to quiz the Queen’s chief ‘bean counter’, Keeper of the Privy Purse Sir Alan Reid, on Monday as part of the royal finances investigation said: ‘It is the first time the PAC or parliament has had this level of access to the Royal Household’s accounts. ‘We want to show we take our responsibilities very seriously and be sure the Royal Household is giving good value for money. ‘I think this kind of scrutiny can only be good for the monarchy.’", "reference": "Monarch set to be given £37.9million next year, up from £31million this year .\nThe Queen is said to be down to her 'last million'\nBut spending on Royal Household has fallen in last 20 years, claims report ."}
{"id": 15495, "article": "Hospitals are to hire Eastern European nurses because so many patients cannot speak English, making it hard for doctors to understand their health concerns. For the first time, NHS trusts in immigration hotspots want to recruit staff from Poland to cope with the language barriers they face every day on their wards. It is hoped the move will improve care for foreign-born patients, cut the Health Service’s £23 million annual bill for translation services, and reduce the lengthy consultation times clinicians must have with non-English speakers. NHS managers want to recruit Polish staff, pictured, to cut down on the service's translation service bill . However, critics say it highlights the strain placed on health care by Britain’s open borders policy over the past decade. New figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to confirm this week that migration to the UK last year was far higher than the Government target of the ‘tens of thousands’. Official figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show there are already 2,473 nurses from Poland working in Britain, with 210 registering in the past year alone. But for the first time it can be revealed that hospitals are also recruiting foreign staff because they will be better able to communicate with patients. The first trust to speak openly of the plan is in Boston, Lincolnshire, which has a larger proportion of Eastern European residents than anywhere else in Britain. Census figures show one in ten of the town’s 64,000 population is from new members of the EU such as Poland or Latvia, and the high birth rate among recent arrivals puts strain on maternity services as well as interpreters. Garry Marsh, deputy chief nurse of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, said: ‘We have a big Eastern European community and the health needs of that population will grow as they age within the UK.’ He added: ‘By looking at recruiting from Eastern European counties, we would introduce nurses that culturally are very responsive to those patients’ needs – the most obvious and immediate barrier we face being the language differences.’ The United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, pictured, has been paying translators £38-an-hour . The trust has 36 nursing places to fill and senior staff are expected to travel to Poland early next year to carry out interviews, having gone on a similar recruiting trip to Greece. A spokesman declined to answer questions about the current number of Eastern European patients it cares for or how many existing staff members are Polish. Figures showed the trust spent £57,000 on language services in 2011-12, up from £45,000 two years earlier. As well as translating leaflets into Polish, the hospital has to hire £38-an-hour interpreters so doctors can understand patients’ problems and be sure they understand treatment being offered. In Norfolk, hospital bosses are also considering hiring foreign nurses. A spokesman for Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Trust said: ‘Recruiting Eastern European nurses is under consideration but there are no plans at this moment to do so.’ Interviews have also been held in Krakow, Poland, to find foreign nurses to fill staffing gaps at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.", "reference": "Hospitals are paying translators £38-an-hour to interpret for patients .\nThere are now almost 2,500 nurses from Poland working in the NHS .\nHospital managers in Lincolnshire plan to specifically recruit Polish nurses .\nThe plan, they hope, will reduce the £57,000-a-year spent on translators ."}
{"id": 15496, "article": "England’s doomed campaign to host the 2018 World Cup is expected to feature far more prominently than the FA would like in Michael Garcia’s report into the corrupt bidding process. The England bid was arguably the most transparent of all those involved in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup elections on which FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert has promised to deliver his verdict next month. But despite the multi-millions allegedly spent by Qatar on winning the 2022 vote, the fear inside Wembley is that England will still be rapped for relatively insignificant breaches of bidding regulations. Garcia wanted extra answers from the FA about four incidents — the £230 Mulberry handbags given as gifts to FIFA executive committee members during a visit to London, the £35,000 sponsorship of a Caribbean Football Union summit, former ExCo member Chuck Blazer’s tour of venues and an FA party at the Saxon Hotel in Johannesburg during the 2010 World Cup. Michael Garcia has delivered a report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . The one certainty about the coincidental departures of FA general secretary Alex Horne and Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay within 24 hours is that they won’t be swapping jobs. Gourlay, an unpopular figure at Stamford Bridge, did well to survive five years in that hot seat, but had become increasingly marginalised by busy chairman Bruce Buck and owner Roman Abramovich’s special advisor Marina Granovskaia. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay (right) speaks with Jose Mourinho during pre-season in 2013 . Manchester City’s £180-a-head corporate package for the game at West Ham on Saturday includes a talk from Ed Sulley, City’s head of research and innovation, on the performance strategies keeping the club at the ‘forefront of the game’… although not necessarily in the group stages of the Champions League. The FA are in talks with former FA Cup sponsors Budweiser about a reduced second tier endorsement. But with the first round fast approaching and no new sponsorship deal in place, it would be a bonus if the American lager brand did another year as the main Cup sponsor to bail out Wembley from embarrassment. Arsenal celebrate after winning the FA Cup with Budweiser final against Hull City at Wembley in May 2014 . Shame about Boat Race . Ascot and headhunters Spencer Stuart spent a difficult year trying to find a new chief executive from outside racing who has experience of running a major venue. So it’s highly surprising that the eventual choice is Guy Henderson, 56, a former litigation lawyer with international firm Allen & Overy and chairman of Wincanton races for the last two years. Ascot will be hoping Henderson steers them on a better course than he took on the River Thames during the 1978 Boat Race when cox of the Cambridge boat that sank in choppy waters. Not that the famous occasion features anywhere on the official Ascot announcement of Henderson’s appointment. The Cambridge boat and crew sink into the choppy waters of the River Thames during the 1978 Boat Race . Troubled sports agency Kentaro have gone into administration in the UK following a number of bankruptcy orders in Switzerland.

Kentaro, who specialised in selling TV contracts across Europe, have never recovered from UEFA’s decision to centralise their Euro and World Cup qualifying rights.

The cost of the initiative is said to be around £10m to be paid for by lottery funding, with Sport England organising this highly expensive project.
